hi this is Charles hoskinson broadcasting live from warm sunny Colorado said those words a lot of times always warm Always Sunny sometimes Colorado but this is a good video it's uh one I'm very proud to make so let me show you some live statistics from gov tools and allow me to be one of the first to congratulate the entire cardano ecosystem for D ratification threshold for the Constitution the cardono Constitution replaced the interim Constitution 85% to 6.62% only 7.68% did not vote and the Constitutional committee threshold 67% was the threshold it's unanimous all seven constitutional committee members voted this means today uh it'll get locked in at the Epic change takes about two days to tally and when that vote goes through as of probably Thursday I believe we will have a constitution for cardano a lot of the abstentions are um people delegating through exchanges they want to get the rewards but uh they don't participate in governance exchanges hold the majority of ADA right now now how about that we did it two years time it was a remarkable Journey uh it took a long long time a lot of effort a lot of people were involved uh more than 65 workshops 1800 people a constitutional convention enormous amounts of debates a lot of uncertainty at times many people wanted to give up and say oh I don't think we can get this done but we did and we brought people together across the world 50 countries got brought together to talk about and create a foundation for cardano to sit upon it's not perfect and already many people have some rough edges and um Bridges but the point is it'll run and it will give us invaluable data and some things will'll love and some things will hate and what we proved is as a completely decentralized organism across the world we were able to come together 85% and the Constitutional committee came together and they voted to create this to embed this in the chain it's it's a constitution by and for the users of cardano because we've done this we've now created a proof point for the rest of time that we can do it again so as we collect all those grievances as we collect all those issues as we collect all those things we'd like to improve or add or change over time we now can update this Constitution which means that cardano is a living organism it's a living ecosystem a vibrant one over 800 DS constitutional committee members 108,000 delegators participating in governance directly delegating to DS and that number is going up dramatically institutions like intersec and um a ton of people building on it and it's Unstoppable we're fully decentralized there's no centralized point of failure in cardano like Bitcoin the only other one that's truly like this cardano is fully decentralized now there's still some gravity Wells of power but you know there's checks and balances and over time those diminish uh so it's a moment for every single person who said it that they would commit to it work on it and get it done I'm proud of all of you and well this final document didn't necessarily reflect everything that you wanted uh it's a Monumental achievement in Social physics people came together they worked together people spoke different languages from different places and they agreed to something at a very high threshold 75% was the threshold that was set imagine the level of consensus you have to to have to get 75% approval I can't remember the last US president that had a sustained 75% approval rating throughout their term was the last time we changed the US Constitution I believe it was the early 90s to give you a sense of it I don't think in this political environment we'd ever be able to get another Constitutional Amendment through at the federal level but we did it here and we did it across the world with people all around who came to know each other through the process and that's uh it's a pretty special day it's a pretty special thing so we have some more things ahead of us uh we have to get the product road map ratified we have to get uh the budget ratified the interm Constitutional committee members will now be replaced so elections will be held second half of the year and the terms expire in September give a little kick in the butt got to get uh all those roles with elected people and that means that uh cardano is uh basically a government a living thing it has a treasury 1.5 billion Ada you're already talking about tax cuts so I know you're real government and we're talking about strategy uh and everybody has ideas of what to do where to go um and who to elevate bring up I couldn't be prouder you know 10 years ago I thought about all this on a whiteboard and I was talking to some people in in Japan and we said ah this is what we're going to do this whole thing it's going to be amazing and extraordinary and special and everybody thought I was nuts and crazy they're like you're gonna create an onchain government and people have never met each other all around the world are just going to go work many of which are volunteers and care about things and vote on things and talk about things and I said yes they shall do that they will do that it's just something that's going to be TR and happen and they said Noah no way no how but they were crazy enough to go on the journey with me and 10 years later we're here we did it and little bit of help and a little bit of pushing from here and there but more importantly you did it you guys got it done this is the direct result of so many people not only taking the process seriously but making the process their own what you'll see is that many of the people who voted yes and no also included their reasons for voting yes or no and I encourage anybody who's delegating to read them they took the time to actually write their thoughts down and be accountable not a Fox News or MSNBC sound bite where they give you 30 seconds of whatever the party line is regurgitated no this is a well-written opinion of why they felt yes or why they felt a no or in some cases abstain some made videos some wrote it some tweeted didn't matter they found a way to at least communicate with you and let you know where they're at and what they did and we as an ecosystem if that's the standard every month we get better every quarter we get better the government gets bigger and more accountable it gets more capable it makes better decisions overall you see the thing is that as we have this Foundation there a lot of people already thinking about what the next version needs to look like it's very much like software and they say well maybe we add quadratic voting you know maybe we add preference orders maybe we find more diverse ways to include people inside the ecosystem so more people participate they're already talking about compensation who gets paid if so when how if not why these types of things and we're tracking everything you can see the level of participation amongst the people people elected are they showing up and regularly voting are they voting well are they giving you answers to why they do what they do it's pretty exciting and that's what the vision was people often ask what's cardano's core USP and certainly there are blockchains with a higher TPS rate and certainly there are blockchains with higher market cap you can always pick some vanity metric and say well that looks better well the po USB of cardano really is the fact that everybody who holds it has a say in it sometimes small sometimes big but you have a say this is just not the case with Bitcoin ethereum or all these other ecosystems they never took the time to believe that you were worth something they never took the time to actually ask you your opinion they never took the time to empower you instead they said the only thing that matters is the code code is law all humans are bad can't trust them for anything what we did is we said let's take the Best of Both Worlds there are algorithms and they matter and they enforce deep principles and they prevent the system from being misused this is the lesson of Satoshi humans in the long run cannot be unilaterally trusted but on the other hand we're tremendously creative and capable people and we have if engaged in the right way the ability to build a heaven and when you constrain people through constitutional law and now algorithmic governance you can bring out the best in people you can hold people accountable you can make sure that people don't become corrupt and thus you get all the good things that they do you get the good will you get the empathy you get the emotions you get the desire to be creative the love of Aesthetics you get all those things the Poetry of the soul and that is what is missing from all these other mechanical systems the humanity of them we spent two years a lot of work trying to chase that poetry of the soul and you know what we prove today unambiguously that not only do we possess it that we want more of it the coming months are going to be a lot of fun the coming years is going to be a lot of fun we got Bitcoin defi we got Laos we got midgard got partner chains cardano's becoming the one of the largest ABS systems in the world all kinds of stuff that's coming down the pipe that will foundationally increase our competitiveness and make it easier to deploy deps better faster cheaper and I don't worry about these things because that's just technology and we've proven Beyond a reason of a doubt we're good at that too 168 scientists 24 40 academic papers 10,000 citations millions of lines of code dozens of development companies now four full nodes under construction we're Diversified and we know how to write code that's good but really what truly matters is that we also have the largest governance layer now which means we're the smartest cryptocurrency ecosystem we can crowdsource any idea any strategy an augmented with AI my Lord we are unstoppable as an ecosystem and not only can we crowdsource it we can also converge to a single common understanding see the dirty secret of decentralization is the more decentralized you become the more difficult it is to actually make a decision about how to change something so while you can preserve the status quo it's almost impossible to actually update the status quo to something better even when everybody acknowledges that that's a good idea we call this the great aifi middle of the internet core Protocols of the internet were developed in the 1970s as a DARPA program by Vince surf Bob Khan amongst others including some people that work for us but yet you ask yourself how often do we update those core protocols and add new and sexy exciting things like quick or Reena and guess what the answer is seldom because it takes so much coordination effort to be able to update modernize that infrastructure and thus we suffer from the consequences of it and have to have a dirty Patchwork of half measures and Solutions in the browser and routers and other things to try to make the internet semi-reasonable as an organism and the same is happening to other cryptocurrencies the larger they get more distant they get from their Founders the harder it is for them to find the social momentum to reach consensus on how to upgrade this the system thus to be competitive what people tend to do is try to centralize the cryptocurrency and then I have to ask how is the cryptocurrency then any different from the very Banks we've been trying to escape how is the cryptocurrency any different from the large monopolistic oligarchies in the tech world that we've been trying to escape from and the totalitarian governments that love to know everything about their people and hold it against them they aren't the expectations of centralization are that you get something in the short term but trade your soul in the long term and we see this again and again in our industry and so in the long term the only option is decentralization and the true innovation of cardano is the centralization with the ability to move as fast as a centralized entity no one has ever achieved that in the cryptocurrency space and today we proved we can everything else is a formality we will win there it's inevitable there's no founder there's no Foundation to crack and fall apart there's no Scandal that can undo cardano we have all the benefits of a Satoshi system but none of the downsides we have the brains we have the largest decentralized brain in the world by wiring all the universities together as our competitors mocked us for white papers and research what they failed to realize was we were putting together a collective intelligence that is self-renewing tell me how a university gets its brains the young go there and they study and contribute and then they move on and more young go there and study and contribute then they move on and by wiring in and creating permanent institutions and these institutions it means that we always have the youngest and brightest working on our problems and as we grow eventually we'll have more youngest and brightest working on our problems than every other project combined so we'll always have a technological advantage and by having a true decentralized governance system that speaks with one voice we can move in a systematic deliberate and efficient way towards executing that Brilliance took a little while to figure out no one had ever done it before it was absolutely insane to enter into a move fast and break things environment and say we were going to follow the rigor of peer-review and formal methods but not only did we achieve it we achieved at a scale that's never been done in human history from Tokyo Tech to Stanford and everywhere in between the Sun never set on the principles of this project and I'm proud of that and I'm proud that in seven years time since we launched soon to be eight we never once deviated from those core principles hundreds of millions of transactions and blocks the Network's never gone down 7 days a week 24 hours a day we've been operating and that is something worth something it tells the entire world there's true value in what we've done and now we've inculcated an entire generation of leaders to carry those torches to carry those flags and push us forward to illuminate the way and they'll inculcate an even larger Next Generation and an even more capable one and while there are many challenges ahead we have to continue investing in the technology of decentralization and we have to be ever Vigilant of threats to the network and we have to continue innovating we all get to celebrate today this is a good day we played a different game than everybody else in the cryptocurrency space and not only did we win this game when they come to play it against us our advantage and Lead is so significant they can never catch us so after 10 years of working on this thank you all for being part of it thank you all for contributing to this moment to this day cardano has a constitution cardano has a government every adaah holder now has a voice and because of that cardano is the global standard thank you all cheers
