hi everyone this is Charles hoskinson broadcasting live from warm sunny Colorado always warm Always Sunny sometimes Colorado so today we learned something we learned that open source is hard why because while we like to believe it's GitHub repo and it's code and all it is is technology use and utility turns out there are human beings behind the keyboard uh so I opened up my Twitter this morning and immediately I saw this big [ __ ] storm where Matias Ben Court said I've been banished from Ain and uh and I just I'm just out and then Lucas comes in and says oh you they call us fascists and they hate everything and there's this war here and I didn't know anything about it I was like oh God why are we doing this but the thing is that in in in broader sense one of the core utilities of a members based organization whether it be the Linux Foundation the Apache Foundation open core Foundation intersect what are all these things is managing the social physics the technology is easy at the end of the day it's GitHub it's git projects you have a little git project thing and you stick that there uh and basically people say this sounds like a real good idea let's go do that but then people get involved people have political and so let me show you a little something here just to show you how surprisingly common this can be so I asked perplexity make a list of Open Source contributors kicked out because of their politics so the Russian Linux Colonel maintainers the Linux Foundation removed 11 Russian maintainers to comply with us sanctions following geopolitical tension and that's unfortunate because a lot of those were ogs of ogs and Linux is Linux right and then there was GitHub suspensions the real big one was Eric Raymond and I remember Eric because he's hero of mine and he wrote this lovely book called The Cathedral and bizaar was one of the first books I ever wrote on open source and so he was kicked out for qu Troublesome behavior in undermining the organization's goals uh because I guess he opposed the OSI diversity initiative so there was a Dei thing I guess then there was Seth Vargo and Chef for ice contracts open AI uh Dean dobot developer I say hey dig a Little Deeper the net filter the Drupal cork contributors citing ideological clashes colors and fake and you know what this is just a cck a quick perplexity search and if you really Dig Dug into there's probably hundreds of people and not all the cases are well politicized so the reality is that people have very different politics at times uh so some people are hard hardcore alt-right extremists some people are hardcore Communists some people really believe in one thing in fact when I was growing up in the Bitcoin days there was a guy named Luke Dash Jr who made Bitcoin blocks and created a little bit of a controversy because he always embedded Bible verses inside those blocks and he has a very very uh unique World fuse and we all loved him uh so I never have problem with people's politics and uh and I I enjoy working with people who are quite diverse and and people have worked with me throughout the ages will know that that's always been the case we didn't start Ain it was an open- source project and the people came together and started working on it and it like all social interactions people uh come from different backgrounds and if they don't have the right structure in place then the problem is over time the things that divide them can become wedge issues and they split apart so it looks like a wedge issue occurred here because the macro became the micro it can seem to be pretty horizontal and it's just this project and people work on it and one of the core maintainers likes me and another one of the cord to maintainers doesn't like me and then kind of worked its way in and uh they say oh well because Charles is doing stuff with Trump or is perceived to be doing that he's a fascist and an evil person the other person says I like that stuff and they split and what the solution is for them talk to each other so uh my understanding is Lucas and Matias are going to talk it out hopefully they can come back together uh and figure that out but the broader longer term solution is to recognize that you need to have members based organizations because they have the structure in place to make sure that everybody has the right to be heard recently I saw some budget proposals where they say we don't need any bureaucracy don't give any money to intersect don't give any money to any of these nbos it's a waste of money it's bureaucracy the whole reason they exist is to prevent these types of things from happening you have two tremendously talented people who are geniuses and they do amazing work and they're incredibly passionate and they've proven their passion about cardono but they have opposing World Views and they have opposing opinions about people and so the whole point of an NBO is to create the infrastructure so these types of people can actually work together productively and effectively and those opposing views don't do that in the absence of it when you have these small horizontal structures over time those become like sandpaper and they create friction and we've seen this throughout all the years um in fact the history of hasool the programming language uh you know uh 1985 it came out why did it come out because the original language that everybody wanted to use was called Miranda and the person created it didn't want to release the intellectual property senseless to try to make money on it but yeah decided to go down that road so all the people were like Rebels and they said screw you man we're going to create our own language and they created the high school working group and they came together and they did that and that's where haskill came from um when Oracle bot uh Sun led to the creation of postgress you notice we have a lot of forked projects floating out there you know and so sometimes these are commercial sometimes these are geopolitical sanctions in Brazil for example led to the creation of the Lua programming language the same thing happened in certain respects in South Africa during a parthy so geopolitics these types of things political views personal opinions that's what makes open source hard and we have just seen today a case study and why uh open source organizations exist for my part I always air on the side of collaboration and I think that these two will find a way to work it out come back together uh and uh you know we'll just move on and it's a teachable moment for everybody because uh what it does is it allows us to reset re re-evaluate that collaboration is hard this is another reason why cardano is one of the most valuable cryptocurrency projects in the world we focused on the governance and collaboration side first and created one of the most complex and uh useful governance layers of any cryptocurrency with lots of checks and balances if you solve governance Tech is easy and you can make forward progress and get things done uh so that's why we invested so much time and effort in money as an ecosystem in and that's why we got DS now and that's why we got constitutional committee members now and every now and then people come and say hey kids cut it out and you know I understand you're passionate Let It Go and come back together because you both care and I'd like to believe that they do and I think this will probably get resolved today one way or the other and uh people will move on but moving forward leave it as a teachable moment that governance matters this happens all the time in open source it is what is it's unfortunate but yeah that's what makes life fun you can't say that you like diversity you can't say that you like different cultures and different viewpoints and not admit the fact that by embracing that you are also embracing the occasional conflict and the occasional debate and so the key is to disagree without being disagreeable and the key is to at times come back together when you realize you're too far apart heart because at the end of the day the things that connect us are a lot closer than the things that divide us so that's all I'll say on this and uh welcome to decentralization it's a fun thing thanks everyone
