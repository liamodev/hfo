hi this is Charles hoskinson broadcasting live from warm sunny Colorado always warm Always Sunny sometimes Colorado today is March 5th 2025 and there's been a lot of speculation on many many things uh the crypto industry is special in that it takes a rumor or news whatever they want they blow it up uh to enormous proportions and they go in as many directions as they can uh and uh the latest event is this interesting little gett together at the White House March 7th so here are the facts uh many of my people uh know people on that side that's a true statement I have emails and text messages to prove that uh and there's been some engagement on whether people are invited or not nobody knew anything about the list we were told that there'd be a list that comes out on Monday uh we did not get an invitation on Monday we did not get an invitation on Tuesday we did not get an invitation today on Wednesday so I'm G to operate under the assumption I have not been invited to go to this Gathering it's a 4-Hour gathering at the White House I guess the president's speaking it's going to be a round table I don't imagine much policy work will be done for the last few months I've been reminding everybody one fact of the American government that may be lost on our International viewers the president signs the laws the legislative branch writes the laws the vast majority of the sustainable permanent action that will be done will be done at the legislative branch level stable coin bill has to be passed the market structure bill has to be passed uh and dozens of other things are going to have to be written into law or authorizations given to the bureaucracy of the United States to standardize things or example when people go well elen musk is going to go use Doge and blockchain the US government blockchain everything okay well how would the dod write an RFP what standards are they going to use is there a fips for it is it like fips 190 or fips 203 no mist is going to have to get involved and dozens of other agencies are going to have to get involved to create a baseline of definitions of what is a blockchain what is a digital asset what is a consensus algorithm what's good what's bad what's decentralized what isn't decentralized before you can even write an RFP for people to bid on that you can't award no bid contracts to people I'll refer you to the Jedi program back in the day so you need an active Congress you need a lot of work in the administrative agencies and the gears of the federal government are slow and methodical a lot of people are trying to jump the fence they're trying to create Optics because that's what our industry does it's a very Optics driven thing I consistently have dinner with congressmen and Senators both former and current uh and I will consistently do that and I consistently get pieces of legislation uh and when I say I it's the Royal eye it's my organization people in the organization are affiliated with it and the lawyers look at it they mark it up and we have an opinion it's something we've done for years whether it be back in 2022 when we were looking at early drafts of FIA or later on when we got drafts of fit 21 as they were working their way through the house you can see pictures and yet meals and events throughout the years and I said back in November we don't really know what's happening on the executive side but on the legislative side we will continue pushing forward on that because that's where the action is I'm not entirely sure and I don't really think anybody really knows what exactly the administrative policy is going to be on the executive branch and these Summits while they're important because they put a spotlight on the topic the real work does require many people from across the Spectrum in a bamal basis to work together to get things done so we have a policy office it's led by Joel telner and Cynthia Cynthia was the one that you all saw recently with Bo Hines and other industry leaders uh then there's a picture on Twitter it's public you can see it but she's also talking to the policy groups that Perry and boring and other people lead and others and we constantly engage and ask well what's going to happen who needs help where for example if there's a standards effort to standardize cryptocurrency definitions or is that working group going to be nexist in nist or somewhere else is it from the Department of Commerce or is it from the treasury Department or somewhere else there's working group at the SEC which are going to be spawned first round has been announced more rounds are coming there's working groups at the cftc that's going to be spawned uh hasn't been announced yet there's probably going to be announced sooner rather than later then they got to work together and that's just two of the many agencies that are going to be involved the defense industry hasn't even gotten involved yet cyber security standards for example have to be set there's dozens of things to do the US government is a leviathan everybody F focuses on the president everybody focuses on the White House because it's simple and easy to do so uh we have tried throughout the last three months to have meaningful engagement and get a better understanding of everything from how they were thinking about creating a crypto are and it's absolutely true statement that before the election and after we made meaningful attempts to reach out to the transition team and talk to them about what they wanted to do and how they wanted to do it and nobody really knew and then AAR was announced okay and other people were announced okay and then it was confusing we'd hear well they're going to have a advisory Council and for a while that was the narrative then we heard on the other side well actually they're going to have these White House Gatherings where people are going to come together and talk okay when and how we'll let you know they announce it on Sunday 6 days notice and everybody's clamoring they want to be in the room and there's so many that want to be in the room there's now like a second event which I guess has an extra 75 people okay and they're all going to talk to each other I guess and they're going to set some policy and then that policy has to go through the ringer because then it has to go to the treasury Department and it has to go to the cftc and it has to go to the SEC and the vast majority of it they'll say actually we kind of need to pass a law and they're going to then go to the Senate and then they're going to go to the Congress going to be talking to Congressman Hill talking to Tim Scott dozens and dozens of people and then when it hits there they say yeah I don't know about that you know uh hang on a second here have you thought about this so whatever is discussed by the time it gets there to make a lot of impact for example no tax on crypto American cryptos what is an American cryptocurrency exactly and how is that standard set is it har bar we can make an argument for it is it padot we make an argument for it is it ethereum well ethereum was founded in Switzerland the Ico occurred in Switzerland the inventor of it is Canadian the majority of the controllers of it are non-american all the development companies were outside of the United States as very minimal us Nexus with the exception of consensus in the beginning which came after the Ico there's a lot of holding and ownership in the United States perhaps more than 50% of the token hard to say is it an American crypto what about Bitcoin is Bitcoin an American crypto we don't know who the founder is the majority of the supply wasn't mined in the US the majority of the hash power isn't the United States So when you say no tax on us crypto what does that exactly mean feel-good statement but it doesn't really have any teeth behind it and certainly would not survive litigation and it certainly would not survive the existing laws we have and if you're actually going to take the duty of writing a law how would you write that law what would you do it's why both branches have to work together and they have to figure this out and as much as we as an industry want this to be a short process it's going to be a long and methodical process which is why we focus most of our policy engagement on the legislative branch as I've told you consistently from November December and Beyond we've tried some engagement with some degree of success on the executive branch side and uh we worked really hard to see if there were any opportunities to be in those rooms and the frustration and challenge for us is we could never get clear answers on such things U not for lack of trying there's been occasional times where we've had the ability to be in the room for various things but none of those things were meaningful from a perspective of setting policy as for example I said on David gin show that we knew nothing of adaah being selected for the reserve it was news to me I woke up on Sunday I looked at my phone I had over 150 messages with saying congratulations a great job and no idea what the heck was going on I said what are you talking about and then I saw the tweet and I said wow that's absolutely amazing and I guess something was done but we never knew anything about it and no one ever even talked to us about it and we tried really hard to have those conversations and uh there was always like we'll call you back or you we'll figure it out stuff is busy the executive branch is the busiest of them they got Wars going on they got tariffs they got deportations they got dozens of policy objectives and considerations uh and I don't fault them for at times being busy and having challenges keeping up with the enormous demand of contact which is why again it's better in many cases when you're talking about things we have to live with for a long time to engage with the legislative branch because they have the luxury of depth and time the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 was passed in 1933 92 years ago that's a long time FDR was President Robert Kennedy's grandfather was the first chairman of the SEC and that law is still relevant today you all know it from the hoe test which was an interpretation of that law from the 1940s as a result of Supreme Court decision there's a lot of case law there and the definition of an investment contract has been updated from time to time but seldom to accommodate what we need a cryptocurrency market structure bill could have as meaningful of an impact 50 years 100 years those definitions could still be in use so this transcends one Administration this transcends one Congress this transcends one set of Industry leaders and actors if you don't believe me tell me what CEO from 1933 is still running his company today what president from that time period is still around what lawmaker from that time period is still around what judge from that time period is still around maybe they're receiving Social Security benefits but they're sure as hell not not in a position of power and authority you pass it on from one to another to another and now we have a window of time two years and some urgency behind it to be considered and deliberate and a broader group of people need to be brought into this process and one of the things that I'm a bit flumm by is there's a lot of people who really need to be in the room who are domain experts who have enormous knowledge about the industry who aren't yet in the room like Leman bar from hashgraph for example who thoroughly impressed me when I spent some time with him or Sylvio moli from alaran for example or Avery Chang from Aptos uh or Benjamin from Multiverse X there's hundreds of these people that we know we've engaged with and we say they understand the technology they understand the markets they understand the underlying science behind the technology they understand how people make money lawfully and not so lawfully because they've run into all these different people throughout the years and they understand every Dimension and aspect of the industry you can't get all those people in the room if it's 25 people an invitation only event at the White House it's just not possible so there needs to be alternative structures for those people to participate in a considered systematic and deliberate way and perhaps the executive branch can bring some of them together but will it also bring the international Regulators together what about the adgm in Abu Dhabi or Vara in Dubai what about the FCA in the UK what about finma and Switzerland what about the Singapore monetary Authority what about Japan's jfsa many of these places have been regulating cryptocurrencies longer than the United States and have billions of dollars of assets there and have had to deal with agency failures regulatory events scams all kinds of things and they have a lot of wisdom and foresight more importantly this is a global industry not just an American industry and as an American I'd love to see this industry grow and Thrive but we have to concede the point that these Global 247 markets are just that they're Global they're 24 hours a day and seven days a week so kind of sort of need to be interoperable with the global regulatory standards so where are those agencies going to engage in this process to make sure that US law harmonizes in a way where assets can freely flow I can construct a crypto transaction that goes to every country in the planet at the same time utxo makes that pretty easy you just have one output matching each country I guarantee you that's the most illegal transaction you can do that's the problem with how these technology Works a cryptocurrency can be 12 things at once they're Financial stem cells every jurisdiction has a window and a view as a particular notion of such things but does not have a clear 100% coverage and they all have to work together the law has to reflect that and give the regulatory agencies of the United States enough flexibility that they're able to work with their counterparts globally or else the industry is not going to work as a whole not withstanding the extremely complex custodial tax standards and a Litany of things that we have to keep up with there's also a question of how much needs to be done with self-regulatory organizations versus actual administrative organizations this is hard and no one person is going to solve it no one bill is going to resolve it and uh those of us who live in this industry we have to live with the consequences of it and we'll be touching it again and again through different congresses and through different administrations it wasn't too long ago that Biden was president and we had to deal with that it wasn't too long ago that I spoke with Congress in 22 22 feels like a lifetime ago but it really wasn't that long ago and I'll be back at some point and it'll be different congressmen and different Senators we'll be back and we'll have that conversation and perhaps their opinions have changed but people who have had negative opinions they've been bolded emboldened by certain events it is what it is you deal with what you deal with it's not helpful as an industry though to treat all of this as some sort of popularity contest and view it like The Bachelor and who gets the row who's in The In Crowd and who's in the out crowd if you believe for a moment that your cryptocurrency is going to do well because somebody went to a vanity Affair you're a fool because it tells you you know absolutely nothing about how the United States government works and absolutely nothing about how policy is made and how people deal with things it also you have to understand that the In Crowd and out crowd it changes very quickly people who were favored in the beginning could suddenly be thrown away by a single anonymous source somewhere or vice versa politics change and there's nothing permanent about anyone's position or standing power is directly connected to the perception of it and the results of elections and we've witnessed that wasn't too long ago that the US government was brutally attacking coinbase and Kraken and xrp now Ada something they said when they were going after coinbase was the security is apparently going to be inside the national Reserve it's a bit of a whiplash if you think of that it's the full embrace it's pretty interesting that's how quickly things change so be nice to everybody don't speak in absolutes and be open to working with everybody and be open to trying to push things along policy office will continue pushing legislation along working with the lawmakers I and trying very hard to have a meaningful inact there to make sure that things are written in a way that stand the test of time my personal goal is for the crypto legislation that gets passed to be written in a way that we can look back at it decades from now and for it to still be relevant like the Digital Millennium copyri act or the nsfa up or many of these other things that founded the internet in the United States and thus for the world that's going to take a lot of work it's going to take a lot of people a lot of bright Minds like the mall and dozens of others and it's going to require a lot of Frank conversations about what doesn't work especially with those who are ahead of the United States like the Europeans with M or what the Middle East has done for Better or For Worse and it takes a little bit of humility to admit what we don't know and it takes a bipartisan appeal for laws to be permanent for laws to be durable for laws to exist longterm you do really need to have people from many political Persuasions involved in the process that's an absolute and when I say things like that it doesn't make me Mr popular right now people want to be of a certain blend but maybe just maybe people from different political Persuasions need to be invited to the table because those political Persuasions represent tens of millions of Americans and collectively philosophies of billions of people worldwide cryptocurrencies can absolutely be used for things that the left cares about good things and they absolutely can be used for things that the right cares about good things we can never allow our policy to get captured in a way to view this technology as an extension of a political party or political philosophy cryptocurrencies belong to everyone in the world every single human and they are the bull workk of protecting human rights the bull workk of protecting your freedom of Association Commerce and expression in extension of your god-given rights not your government- given ones and don't believe for a moment that any political party deserves the right to be the custodian of such policy they have to work together in order to make sure that things are built in a way that the law respects the place and purpose of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency Technology so I had travel plans to go to Japan supposed to get on a plane here in a little bit and I will be Friday the 7th in Japan I'm good operator on the assumption that I'm not going to this event especially after this video and that's okay I'm always available for a phone call and I'm always available for an email and uh I have very strong opinions about things where they should go what they should do how they should do things and I'll Express those opinions to those who ask me but my primary job is not lawmaker my primary job is cryptocurrency CEO every single day I wake up and I ask questions like how do I get more adoption for cardano how do I Implement Leos how do I get Bitcoin defi done how do I ship midnight how do I build the Next Generation dap how do we get the next white paper written of which we have over 240 research papers with people all throughout the world many of which are the brightest Minds in the world and how do I turn those papers into the future products that people care about not for Americans but for the world I'd like America to be part of that story and I was deeply saddened over the last four years to see the Biden Administration caused such Grievous harm and damage and trust but don't think for a moment that when I wake up I say cardano is for America when I wake up I say cardano is for the world it's always been the case it's why we were in Africa and continue to be in Kenya it's why I went down to Argentina and we had our constitutional convention there and while the US flag was well represented by a West Point grad down in you in uh in Argentina during the uh Constitutional Convention there were 49 other flags that complemented at that convention and everybody came together as one group in unity with the belief that the technology can bring us all together because it's it's truly global technology I remembered that Satoshi remembered that when he wrote about Bitcoin theic at times has mentioned that in his writing a lot of the ogs who been around for a long time have never forgotten that because we've had the luxury to travel been to 75 countries since I became a cryptocurrency entrepreneur I've met people everywhere from Mongolian camel herders the people in Zanzibar and rundi to Kings in the Middle East and every single person in between and when I look at all of them I say they are all truly equal under what we are building as an ecosystem and that's a good thing so I will be in Japan on Friday with the cardano community the same group of people that trusted us a long time ago in 2015 to go on this insane journey to go and build something to change the world world and we'll be there to talk about the cardano budget that's the most meaningful and important thing to me right now and we'll be there to talk about the road map of cardano in the future of it and how we achieve adoption amongst many other things the coming weeks and months a lot of political stuff to do in fact JJ's already in DC doing various things uh and many people especially in the legislative branch to engage with but by the way we're certainly going to be talking to Regulators in Japan and we're going to be talking to Regulators in the Middle East and we're going to be talking to Regulators in Europe and we're going to be talking to Regulators in South America and we'll be talking to Regulators in Africa all the places you can imagine we'll go and talk and engage with them because they have people too and their people are cardano users too there's nothing more joyous for me than to be in a place I've never been and for somebody to come up to me who knows me and says I use a and as much as my heart would want aah to stand for America's digital asset stands for a love lace a person I deeply admire and respect but also a person who had the foresight to give Humanity the first computer program Computing liberated the world and it gave us a space to think into I like naming things after people that give us stuff or remind us of great lessons both good and bad leers changed my life and made me the person I am today and gave me the ability to do amazing things that no human would normally be able to do and I'm so grateful to her contributions which is why we named a the way we did and every single person who holds it gets to honor that message and that mission regardless of what country you're from who you're from great Empires they come and go but human rights they have to stay Prince principles have to stay Inspirations stay the 21st century is going to be crazy this Tuesday company I'm invested in announced the woolly Mouse they took woly Mammoth jeans and they put it in the mouse think about that they're really cute and they're fluffy soft that's the world we live in now the world that has willly mice imagine the world's going to look like in five years in 10 years in 15 years in 20 years what's going to get us there people waking up every day and trying to do some good work with each other what's going to get us there is the centralization in the bottom up the president doesn't have the power you do never forget that the people collectively have the power and power comes from coordination what we demonstrate in the cryptocurrency space is the ability for hundreds of millions of people across the world to coordinate and build a parallel Financial system to compete with a system led by people with trillions of dollars and giant militaries and we're winning as seductive and tempting as it can be to have the US government or any government get involved in our space to create temporary Market distortions we must never forget the reason why cryptocurrencies exist is so that we no longer need governments we can transcend them that my friends is why we're really here and what we're really doing policy helps us get there but ultimately we have to make a decision what do we believe in do we like what we have or do we want to change and I made that decision a very long time ago when I was a lot younger a lot thinner didn't have this white in the beard that I wasn't happy with what I had it's why I campaigned for Ron Paul and ever since that day every day I've woken up I've tried to change things to push things along had some good days had some bad days had some fun days I've enjoyed a lot of this and I continue to stay because I think I can still make a difference so that's what we're doing so I'll see you guys in Japan on Friday thank you so much for all that you've done for me and thank you to the Japanese Community for being the heart and soul of the beginnings of cardano you mean a lot to me and there's Frankly Speaking nowhere I'd rather be right now than there and then next week I'll be somewhere else and next week I'll be somewhere else I'll keep moving I'll keep traveling we got a lot of work to do we got the road map to finish we got the budget to finish got Laos to do we got midgard to implement we got Bitcoin defi I'll be at all the major events blockchain parce and token 2049 and Bitcoin 2025 talk to all the major people push things along we will get that done and I hope for the best for America I really do I live there it is my home and as I've said my bones will be buried there when I die and you may notice in every live stream I got an American flag behind me I love this country and I really hope for the best and I do believe we will get there but I also believe it's going to take some sacrifice and pain and struggle and sometimes some of us have to take harder roads which are less popular but nothing great is ever achieved when people seek admiration love and accolades greatness comes only when you're tested and when you don't get the accolades but you do it anyway that was the story of where America got founded and we'll remember that story again there's so many great Americans out there and thank you for being part of my family too the most fun I've had has been traveling all around the nation state after State and meeting some real cool people with amazing Stories proud of all of you proud of what you've done proud of the struggles you've gone gone through and how you've survived and thrived throughout them you mean a lot to me and know that I saw it firsthand and it renewed and reinvigorated my belief and the exceptionalism of this great nation so until next time have a wonderful day see you in Japan
