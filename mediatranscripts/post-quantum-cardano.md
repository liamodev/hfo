hi this is Charles hoskinson broadcasting live from warm sunny Colorado always warm Always Sunny sometimes Colorado so today is February 20th 2025 we're going to talk a little bit about things that can be done to make cardano postquantum I know a lot of people are interested in this video a lot of people want to talk about this so uh as you saw in my prior video the quantum computer world is heating up quite a bit and a lot of magical amazing things are happening uh meirana is a huge step forward mairana with Microsoft but not far behind it uh there are a lot of great companies working on quantum computers building things uh in the quantum space it is my belief that in 5 10 years we'll probably make substantial progress to the point where we really have to start thinking about updating modernizing the cryptography now turns out that it's not just my belief it's the United States government belief as well people who are paid to care the National Institute of Standards of Technology nist uh what they did is proactively got together and talked to many many people including some of our cryptographers and they created some standards so this is a article from August 13 2024 and it says NY releases the first three finalized postquantum encryption standards and there's Chad you know you know it's good when you got Chad how about that um and basically what they did is they wrote some fips and they have fips 203 fips 204 fips 205 and fips 206 the federal information processing standard 203 is about General encryption there's two signature schemes One is using the crystals delium algorithm which has been rename ml DSA modest ladu uh module lce based digital signature algorithm the other one is actually by Sphinx which is a long and interesting Legacy if you guys ever use zcash Zuko was affiliated with that and this is actually comes from the alran community alran is one of the pioneers and leaders in the postquantum standards and they worked and created something called Falcon and true Lattis based digital signature algorithm in fact Al alran wrote this lovely blog post saying leading on postquantum technology and uh they mentioned their work with nist inside the article uh and they also discussed a little bit about some of the things that they've been thinking about and doing so uh they have state proofs that are post Quantum secure compact certificates and they kind of developed a bunch of stuff we worked with the ALR guys on an extension to myth roll called Alba Alba uh and we can certainly follow a similar approach and then they also talked a little bit about updating the vrf function to be postquantum but in general you need to actually model postquantum adversary all right and so they have a pretty sanguin uh an interesting write up so highly recommend it in fact I'll give you guys the link to it here and there you have it and then you see some really magical schemes they're starting to work their way through in particular like Lattis fold this from Dan Bonet and bigny Chen and it just came out it's hot off the press ltis f plus uh and boy it is a intellectual tierd Force this is one of the best foldings papers I've I've ever seen um math is sharp there's a lot of really novel and interesting things field size is only 64 bits there's there's all kinds of goodies here this is an amazing paper long and short though it's a compact folding scheme so you have basically proof carrying data and you roll up stuff so what I'm going to do is I'm going to present my screen talk a little bit about what we're going to do in card cardo uh what I propose we ought to do so in cardano the challenge that we have is that we use elliptic curve cryptography as kind of the basis of security for most things so everything involves a signature and these signatures are on elliptic curve crypto and the problem is we have this thing called Shores algorithm and Shores algorithm basically if you have a quantum computer the qued computer can kill the security of that there's some things we can do to harden and evade but in general this is an insecure scheme assuming your adversary has a quantum computer so what a lot of people in the blockchain space do is they say oh well what we did is we got a postquantum signature scheme and thus we're Quantum secure and that couldn't be further from the truth just because you've adopted one of those n standards or something more exotic doesn't necessarily mean that you're Quantum secure in cryptography what you do is you invent a concept of an adversary an adversary okay and this person we'll call him Mr a what they do is they have a collection of capabilities and those capabilities are things that you decide Upfront for your security model and your security proof So when you say you are secure what you're doing is you're saying you're secure against an adversary given a set of capabilities and you say what what type of capabilities well like question of how much compute power you can ask things like do they have access to your computer you you can ask you know more practical things for example uh online offline okay and then special capabilities like they have a quantum computer for example that's not the only thing they could potentially have so anytime you think about a security model you have to really think about Mr a you have to say Okay this adversary what are we going to give him in terms of capabilities and what does he know in terms of capabilities so General when we write a cryptographic proof or security proof we make a lot of things like Ci's principle is one which basically says that the security of the system should rely upon the secrecy of the keys and nothing else in other words the algorithms the adversary is going to be able to backward engineer and understand so if there's something that keeps it secure through obscurity it's not considered to be secure and there's dozens of good design principles that exist like well over a 100 when you talk about information security and these systems and even if the algorithms are perfect the algorithms run in hardware and all the time the hardware lies to you and these are things called like side Channel attacks a great example is that years ago a paper came out of Israel was a very clever paper where people were using pgp and they broke pgp because what they could do is they could listen to the laptop of somebody in a coffee shop and as keys were being encrypted and decrypted they had a microphone and that microphone could listen to the frequency changes in the computer processor in the laptop and figure out the ones and zeros that were going on there and it could over time through listening through repeated encryptions and decryptions recover the private key how about that remarkable paper pgp is secure it's based on the rsa's assumption but we don't assume that the adversary has this special capability and we don't assume an environmental particular in the security model so while it's secure in general in this particular case this would defeat the security scheme so you could defeat things in a classical sense you can defeat things in electrical engineering sense you can defeat things with a $5 wrench and beating a person until they give you a key you could defeat things with special capabilities like quantum computer for example it's really remarkable stuff and I'm really excited uh you know about these things which is why I study cryptography and I've spent so damn long in this field and we've written 240 papers as a research group we're pretty good at it input output about this and agalo is one of the best Chief scientist in the world so kudos to what he's built there what he has so really there has to be a three-step process if you want to make cardano secure first we have to develop a Quantum secure model for cardano and that's end to end so we would audit all of the algorithms that cardono is using and we would ask which ones vulnerable against a Quantum adversary and what capabilities do we have so we have to kind of Define a canonical Quantum adversary and that in itself is an interesting question and uh there's various opinions in the cryptographic community about what uh we should assume there and what they can and can't do okay so that's the first step then the second step is you want to separate cardano into two pieces there's cardano blockchain and there's cardano proof chain and this is kind of a meta blockchain this is why I'm bringing up ZK fold not ZK fold um lattice fold plus all right so this is the cardono you know and love stuff is happening nice little chain of stuff like that dot dot dot dot great and it lives in the elliptic curb crypto World awesome then we have technology like mithil very similar to what alran is doing with their compact certificates and what you can do is you can upgrade this to a postquantum signature system okay and there's many different options that we have there all right and then what you could do is you can have this be a companion of cardano and basically it runs as an audit log of History so you have an unforgeable system that has signatures related to the original history and effectively this acts as a checkpoint system but over time this can become a programmable proof chain and then it can be used to prove properties of things from cardano it's self so for example the utxo State Properties about the daps and it functionally becomes kind of a DA layer over time now since this is kind of an emergent construct there's no reason not to do this with a postquantum why we typically try to avoid it from occurring on the main chain at the moment is many of the postquantum signature schemes are 5 to 10 times the size of elliptic curves and also they're much much slower and they're doubly slower they're slower because the algorithms themselves are slower but then they're also slower because there's no Hardware optimization at the moment your computer processors whether you have an AMD chip or an Intel chip or an arm chip or an apple chip all of them have specialized circuitry called as6 inside of the chips that optimize and speed up standardized crypto like AES and hashes and these things in some cases 50 to 100 times faster so when you go from an optimized crypto to a standard to a non-standard crypto not only do you get a Slowdown from the algorithm but then you don't have Hardware optimization big problem so they're much much slower in practice well what does that mean means your TPS rate for your blockchain goes down by a factor of five to 10 and it means your block sync time goes way way way way up that's one of the reasons why we didn't launch cardono with one of these primitive schemes uh a because it was a lot slower and B it's not standardized yet and what would happen if cardano's running a non-standard postquantum signature scheme it would mean that the people who adopt the standard ones run 50 to 100 times faster and we will always have a hardware disadvantage so we had to wait for nist to say yo dog we have standards now and that's why fips 203 204 205 and 206 are so important because now that they're there Hardware manufacturers will start building custom capabilities to speed these types of things up so the second stage is you just develop this proof chain and actually it would be extremely interesting to see if we could develop such a thing with lattice fold plus because then we'd gain a really powerful folding scheme that's programmable with cardano and it adds a lot of value but a light touch would be just a chain of mithil certificates that have some finality behind them and they're signed with a postquantum scheme okay then the third phase is eventual integration so as the pqss schemes get more advanced plus we develop a postquantum vrf the vrf is an essential component random number generation uh in uh the use of proof of stake when we develop those types of things uh plus whatever the quantum adversary requires then we can put that into the chain and merge The Meta chain and the main chain together into kind of one homogeneous structure so they both run concurrently and consensus is connected this way getting a postquantum mithil certificate probably the proofs of equivocation and Laos will use uh mithril it's pretty trivial for us to update the signature scheme there so we can begin the postquantum movement a little faster and there's a ton of optimization that we can do and we have to make some hard decisions we have to make a decision whether we want to live in hash land and or do we want to live in lattice land the land of lates it's a magical land with puppies and dragons and unicorns so these are things like xmss Sphinx Starks lates or things like crystals and Lattis fold and these types of things I like lates a bit more because lates allow a lot more mathematical complexity many professional cryptographers and uh developers like hashes more because hashes actually are much simpler much easier to implement L things can go wrong lates seem to have a lot more opportunity for program ability update ability and conciseness hashes tend to be a little larger and they're much more limited in the use and utility so it's harder to implement stuff like Starks it's h you can do super interesting things with lattice like what just happened with lattice fold for example but kind of the three steps and there's no way to get around it now terms of time Horizons uh what we're going to do is augment our budget request a little bit and ensure that there sufficient funding to bring some World experts in to augment who we already have so that during 2025 and 2026 the fundamental science of a Quantum adversary can be kind of figured out all right and the security model in general in the interim I do believe that we can pick a n standard and uh we can Implement that with mithil and start working on this proof chain concept and then what happens is that you have an audit log of cardano's history as a checkpoint uh that is quantum resistant so it means quantum computers can't break that instantly uh that's there and this can be done in the two to threeyear Horizon quite easily and there's many ways to accelerate it and Laos is already pushing that direction mythal's evolution is pushing that direction but then this is useful in its own right because it can act as kind of a DA layer and you also use it as a proof layer of the system so you can prove a lot of great properties so that's an organic thing that can happen the merger probably in this case it's good to re-evaluate more foundational things including The Ledger model itself is utxo still the best accounting system or are there different ways to look at it there's also concept of intents inside the blockchain space and there's different ways to look at that there's actually algebraic representations uh algebraic ledgers a gabby for example came up with one um that uh is really interesting person not a project so there's many different ways you can look at The Ledger structure and then we had this concept that Bruno came up with cheric ledgers where you combine multiple Ledger architectures together why is this relevant because if you're going to foundationally change all of the cryptography inside your system it's probably good for housekeeping to also look at how you architect the data representations inside the system as well so what authenticated data structures do you use so an ads is something like a Merkel tree um you also look at um your signature schemes uh what private data remains on chain how data is represented see a lot of people talk about dags but in general you can also look at graphs you know and do you want to actually have a different representation of these types of things increasingly relevant when you have intense and you have identity because that typically is a graph data structure all the way through lot of research and thought so this is three years plus and hopefully in the optimizations we'll get Hardware to optimize that and uh hopefully we will also get uh some more maturity in the standards uh for that because they're preliminary standards they just came out the entire US government has to move here in fact the NSA already has moved their swed a protocols to postquantum so uh so they're they're doing it because of the archive data attack how long do we have that's the big question one of the things you learn in information security is security is temporal is always temporal always always always and what do I mean by that means that things are only secure for a bounded period of time is it all but Charles how do you know okay let's say you hire a security guard and he's guarding your bar of gold very very competent and capable security guard little tie on give him a little gun there we go like the world's worst artist right okay well here's the problem are humans Immortal no so your guard dies at some point retires quits not exactly ideal so between a period of time perhaps the guard is effective but perhaps in a different period of time he's no longer effective money ran out guard died whatever stand for algorithms compute power and compute techniques are always growing there is no greater example of that than with the bomb from Bletchley Park where the Nazis had something called the Enigma machine and I actually have seen one I've been trying to buy one put in the office it's so cool and it was a special crypto machine that they developed and they believed it was unhackable and a certain respect they were right but they didn't anticipate the creation of a computer because if you had to break these things by hand it was extremely timeconsuming extremely expensive and very difficult and it required a lot of advanced math but with a computer you could run all of that and the computer could be a special purpose device simply to decode these messages and that's exactly what Allen Turing did it was a great story in World War II led to the popul I ization of computers so this exponentially improved compute power and it was a new compute technique there was a lot of amazing things these guys came up with for that pretty cool stuff awesome so quantum computers are just another bum and the Enigma machine are the classical crypto algorithms that we have today they work really well assuming of annoyment architecture standard everyday computer not so well when you have a quantum computer it gets the sneak peek that allows it to figure out that private key not so good and that's okay because you can always develop a new Enigma machine you can have a postquantum signature scheme what's really cool about cryptography is this concept of cat and mouse the cat always chases the mouse so you have your algorithm and your computer and they're always chasing each other it's an eternal journey and they're never going to stop so that's what's going on here and with Mariana from Microsoft and all the other cool things we have a new cat so we now need a new mouse so we will get there good news is cardano is is very well placed for all of this we have uh some of the best cryptographers in the world working at IO and with IO we're also well positioned we're at Stanford and CMU and University of Edinburgh and all these other places so it's not an access or Brilliance problem it's just a prioritization problem and I get asked about you know every month or two hey what are we doing about quantum computers what are we doing and then you know Willow gets announced and now uh Microsoft's uh toppo capacitors get announced and a lot of people get very excited about these things and predictably they say hey oh my God does this mean cardano's broken and then tomorrow all cryptography is defeated um and the answer is no but the answer is that something that potentially was 20 or 30 years we're now starting to believe that we're in a 5 to 10 year Horizon for that capability so the urgency in the road map to start thinking around these problems in a more structured way as opposed to an academic way goes up and the good news is that we don't have to be Geniuses we just have to make some decision as an ecosystem what tradeoffs are we willing to live with how quickly do we want to integrate things and how do we integrate things from the part of input output research first principles based uh adversarial modeling and Quantum security modeling has to be done we need kind of a universal composition notion in the in the world of quantum computers and this is interdisplinary we need to bring in some people and really have some great discussion great news is we have people like Alexander in the group who's a domain expert in this respect um so I think we have the appropriate people they just have to be incentivized and we got to get them working a little faster and then working more collaboratively across the industry so that's a supplemental budget request there not a lot but it's a fundamental thing and every protocol has to be systematically checked so we have to update the oror paper for this type of adversary for example the second part the concept of a proof Ledger there's already several things that are good candidates to start looking at this uh that rely upon mithil or mithil adjacent and I think certain projects potentially like midgard for example could be modified uh to facilitate this for cardano and then that's the very first point where we start introducing postquantum artifacts into cardano's ecosystem and that creates a historical stop Gap we have records of account that cannot be tampered with and reversed so you have a mini blockchain then the third step is overhauling and updating the system to merge these Concepts together and it's an opportunity for us to go beyond extended utxo and capture a lot of the really cool stuff that's going on and potentially use a different mathematical structure than a utxo graph uh for cardano's accounting system uh so and plus new authenticated data structures you see vitalic a lot talking about Merkel Patricia tries and veral trees and these types of things they also add a new hash thing like penderson hashes um Poseidon hashes excuse me not penderson commitments so they they have all these crazy ideas that are floating around inside their ecosystem so pretty good but it's an endless game of cat and mouse because you know what the minute you come up with a cool interesting postquantum scheme some brilliant bearded MIT information theorist Quantum information theorist will be like got you [ __ ] got something ha they'll have a new algorithm for you and you're damn it and then you have to go and build something new and that's okay uh the modern-day public cryptography has been good to us since 1976 it's very durable and we've been using it and elliptic curb cryptography has been very good to us since the 1980s and 1990s again it's been very good to us so it's pretty nice that it's been so durable not many things in technology have lasted as long as that um if you don't believe me it's like pull out your Blackberry phone and tell me how awesome that user experiences or your Nokia chocolate bar you know your little candy bar noia feature Pham these things used to be the big hot [ __ ] in technology cost a lot of money and everybody wanted one now they're in landfills or museums and the fact that the algorithms designed around those time periods there still being used today it's pretty impressive they're still relevant today being built on it's frustrating because uh you have to retool a lot of stuff and a lot of the tools techniques and uh optimizations that we've gotten used to we can't use anymore elliptic curves are one of the most amazing and magical inventions of mathematics and Neil coblitz who's a friend of mine he's a great guy uh he deserves a lot more credit than what he got uh the Brilliance of taking something like that and finding this type of use case has created an entire generation if not two of good cryptography in fact he wrote a lovely paper called the serpentine path of elliptic curb crypto explaining all the benefits but also how difficult it was to get it integrated into the broader cryptographic space uh and it's kind of sad that now we're moving in a slightly different direction and now we have different math that we deal with the good news is there is elegant math and there are ways to update um elliptic curbs to be Quantum resistant they're called super singular isogenes but uh super [ __ ] hard and not necessarily secure we're not sure it's jia's work at um waterloop that's doing that so um we'll see in any event uh cardano is not caught with its pants down uh we're ready for this uh we just were waiting for nist do its job and this did we're proud of them for that and now we have to have some conversation through the technical steering committee and the product committee at the io side we'll do the foundational research uh and we'll also work with some of the specialized companies like gawa and others who are experts and implementing cryptographic algorithms and talk around which algorithms we need to update modernize and clean up the other thing is if we use any foreign crypto uh we will have to audit it so a lot of these things are we're going to work real closely with the people who wrote those libraries to do formal security audits on all of these uh cryptographic implementations to make sure that they're secure because I know every single person who uses cardano has come to appreciate and sometimes take for granted that we do it right we use formal methods and uh we're rigorous about what we do and it's unheard of to have these things be hacked when you change your plumbing you damn well make sure you have a master plumber because those leaks are expensive to fixs and sometimes you lose the house and we uh we don't want that to happen all right I hope this helps everybody who's been hearing about it I know a lot of you asked this question and please do use this video to uh whenever somebody comes up what's cardano's postquantum strategy and uh it's going to be a kickoff point for a lot of conversations uh they'll be happening at intersect uh through the TSC and also be happing our research group and if people are really interested in it what we will do is do a workshop in University of Edinburgh what's cool is people can meet some of the cryptographers all right thanks for listening everyone cheers
