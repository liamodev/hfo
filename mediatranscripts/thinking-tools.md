hi this is Charles hoskinson broadcasting live from warm sunny Colorado always warm Always Sunny sometimes Colorado today is February 13th we're making another video talk today a little bit about some of the old things we used to talk about remember old Charles you guys all did before politics went crazy we're kind of going back to that you know we're kind of getting back to that um the premise of this video is that we're all damaged in a a little bit we're all the victims of Relentless and unending propaganda mainstream media and what's happened is it's become exceedingly difficult for us to truly understand and empathize with each other and people have gotten to a point where it's very very hard for us to really have a conversation we talk past each other so I wanted to make a video and kind of show you guys uh two different memes in a video uh and uh just kind of talk a little bit about where the future is going to go and I'm going to show these memes through the lens of artificial intelligence and actually show how cool it is to walk our way through so let me go ahead and bring up my screen all right let me just close that and let me close the other one real quickly H I have the resize ones that are a little bit better all right you guys ready so I thought this was pretty funny W so here's a little meme about El musk Rocket Man you own a store your store gets robbed Elon looks at the video footage of the robbery and tells you who did it now you want to arrest Elon you're an idiot this is floating all around Twitter now your politics Will completely guide your interpretation of this picture if you are right leaning you'll look at this and say yeah that's kind of funny that's true if you're left leaning perhaps you're now going just angry just really angry and just like that's not fair that's not what's going on you support fascism Nazi Hitler whatever blah blah blah now the reason why I don't have a lot of sympathy right now for the left-hand side I've been traumatized you left people talk about victimization really horrible things happened during the Biden Administration with cryptocurrency space and frankly with our government as a whole and we were lied to every single day some people don't want to admit that but happen uh and a lot of us are just really enjoying kind of Liberation from that terrible situation now if you're of that persuasion you fail to acknowledge that things can exist and the broader point of the video is that artificial intelligence is here to help us restore our empathy and Humanity if we choose to use it that way so let's take a look at something here so I got this little meme analysis and I went ahead and put it in chat GPT 40 and I put up the meme and I saidh how accurate is this meme now it's not going to be able to fully understand it unless it's been contextualized so the first thing is just generally speaking about Elon Musk and I said no it's about Doge and because musk was so much into Dogecoin it thought that so he had to orient it so I said no no no no it's about the department of government efficiency and it says I understand you're referring to a meme that compares elen mu role in the department of government efficiency to a scenario where he provides helpful information but is criticized instead of the actual wrongdoer let's assess the accuracy of this analogy in the context of must involvement in Doge so his Roland Doge the objectives of at January 25th uh president Trump established the department of government efficiency via an executive order appointing Elon Musk to lead the initiative the primary goal of Doge is to reduce federal government spending by identifying and eliminating wasteful expenditures downsizing the workforce and potentially closing certain agencies actions taken under must leadership Doge has implemented aggressive measures including dismantling agencies like the United States uh for international devel agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau these actions have been Justified as efforts to cut cost improve efficiency analyzing the meme analogy the meme liens must someone who identifies a problem wasteful government spending it takes action to address it critics perspective critics argue that must approach is overly aggressive and lacks transparency legal challenges have been raised concerning Doge Authority and potential overreach of its actions concerns have also been expressed about the impact on federal employees and potential erosion of essential government functions conclusion the meme suggests that musk is being unfairly criticized for attempting to improve government efficiency however the analogy oversimplifies the situation while must efforts aim to address legitimate concerns about government spending the methods employed by Doge have significant implications including potential legal challenges impacts on federal employees in possible elimination of essential Services therefore while the meme captures a sentiment that musk is being blamed for his reform efforts it doesn't fully account for the complexities and consequences associated with his actions and it has a bunch of links I said what's wrong with El just telling us what's going on Doge doesn't have any authority to fire people and it replies you're absolutely right if Elon Musk through the department of government efficiency is merely identifying waste in efficiencies or corruption in government spending then it would be unfair to blame him for the consequences of that information being exposed that aligns with the mem's analogy must just watching the footing and footage and Reporting what he sees yet people want to arrest him instead of addressing the real problem key points to consider Doge's role is advisory not executive okay legally only the president can do this must influence is still huge even though Doge doesn't have firing power its recommendations carry significant weight why the backlash critics aren't necessarily upset about identifying inefficiencies but about the method the lack of transparency and the ideology so is the meme accurate gives me a little chart there yes if musk is just pointing out problems being unfairly blame for the Fallout no if musk influences directly indirectly causing large scale firings and shutdowns so then you know it's an interesting thought experiment you see how could this process be improved and then you let it think for a little bit one increase the transparency in public input publish detailed justifications for recommendation Rec recommended Cuts including cost benefit shareholder Improvement federal employees economists and affected citizens should be consulted before making drastic recommendations live debates and public Q&A why right now the process appears to be tapped down and unilateral making people feel like the cuts are being dictated rather than discussed to prioritize reform over just cuts efficiency first instead of mass layoffs focus on modernizing out dated processes limitating waste not people Target wasteful contracts and bureaucratic redundancy and performance metrics introduce measurable performance benchmarks rather than just cut things and independent oversight bipartisan review and then of course they phased an implementation pilot program must role as a data provider not executioner bottom line you can make it consultative datadriven gradually measured Al so how could this process be made to be bipartisan and then goes ahead and in produces some ideas to make it bipartisan like any recommendation affecting more than 500 million funding or 10,000 jobs should require something like this and I say well hang on a second here wouldn't this dramatically slow things down yes adding bipartisan oversight and gradual implementation would slow the process down but that might actually be a good thing and here's why efficiency versus stability a necessary trade-off rapid Cuts May save money immediately but can cause chaos a loss of essential government functions legal challenges Mass layoffs without transition plans slower bipartisan changes and Sher reforms stick and aren't undone when political power shifts so instead of slowing everything down focus on fast-tracking obvious inefficiencies voting political reversals if Doge moves too aggressively under one Administration the next Administration might undo everything out of political retaliation example military based re closures required bipartisan based realignment en closure missions which ensure that closures lasted across administrations and Bureau Bureau bureaucracy already slows everything down use that to your advantage govern government agencies are notoriously slow and bureaucratic inertia makes radical change different difficult instead of fighting the system Doge could work within it by pushing for incremental reforms traction and it makes a little table here okay so this is a pretty balanced conversation I don't think this is saying oh my God the Democrats are the most amazing people in the entire world oh we just we just have to love everything they do it's quite a sanguin and responsible discussion and so you can keep engaging with it and keep adding to it what if I feel the government is so broken something dramatic has to be done wouldn't Doge make sense in that context and you can start putting your position there if you believe the government is fundamentally broken needs dramatic immediate reform then a more aggressive approach like Doge could make sense but only if it's done strategically to avoid complete chaos the key question is do you want permanent efficiency or just rapid disruption and then you kind of think about this what does a more radical doge look like immediate spending freezes some wasteful programs Mass agency audits was tight deadlines for improvement a public facing platform for exposing government efficiencies real time example musk Doge publishes report naming the 10 most wasteful agencies every month these agencies get a 90 days to fix efficiencies or the budgets get slashed automatically no Congressional approval needed for spending cuts below a certain threshold this would create high-s speeed accountability forcing agencies to justify budgets constantly risk of high speeed legal challenges public backlash power swings make it All Temporary compromise of radical but smart reform see now we're thinking right and that's the point of AI is it gives you a thinking tool to think into and you can start thinking around these types of things or what you can do is you can just live in the comfort of the picture and you can say you know I just like this picture feels comfortable it's my thing and I just want to wrap my identity around it so what you're basically saying is that the people on the other side they just don't care at all about any of the things I care about and thus it's very easy for you to call them the other and discount them the left wants to call every single person on the right a Nazi I'm firmly convinced of it because that's what they keep doing I just see every headline every statement racist sexist homophobe Nazi you don't care you don't care there's no room for satire and humor there's no room for understanding and empathy and uh a lot of people on the right are so tired of it and so brittle about it that they write off pretty much everybody in the left and you notice because this doesn't have a particular political party it belongs to it's just a dialogue and you can go back and forth you could start really thinking around and you know what the reality is the vast majority of people are probably somewhere in the middle where maybe this is a bit too extreme but because no one feels listened or heard they're willing to embrace the extreme because they've been pushed to one side or the other and the options we have are saying either the government doesn't need to be changed at all or no meaningful reforms need to be made because we've been asking for them for 20 plus years and pentagon's failed audits seven years in a row hundreds of billions of dollars keep missing uh and we just see year after year it get larger and we're told we have to raise taxes or we radically reform but this does bring up a very valid and extremely important point the legal challenges are going to slow it down anyway so you're going to in lawsuits for years and we're already starting to see that happen and also there's a very strong possibility in 2026 Democrats will retake the house and if that's the case they could basically undo most of the things you need because the legislative branch controls the pur strings so if you want to make this permanent instead of just a feel-good temporary thing you have to start thinking in terms of this you have to actually start digging into it and saying well is there a way to bring people along for the ride even people we don't like and that's the power of having a thinking tool That's The Power of making deliberate and considered decisions and you know this is how I work when I actually make business plans within my organization I have my hot takes on Twitter and people are so polarized and politicized that they think that everything must be just impulsive gut feeling Behavior but when we actually make business decisions business plans when we're thinking about hiring and firing people and doing things things we don't only just do this we do this times 10 100x you know uh great example would be sit down here and switch over the model don't think it'll make me allowed to do that so I'll just do this right here develop a pace plan as if I was Elon running do so come from military lingo pace primary alternate contingency and emergency and it can start developing a pace plan how about that can execute government efficiency reforms under any circumstances even if faced with resistance legal barriers or political opposition so primary legislative bureaucratic reform alternate executive aggressive executive action contingency high-speed agency downsizing public pressure an emergency decentralized reform and federal showdowns all the different things that can happen you start thinking about it you say okay what's the pace plan for this you know and then start asking questions like uh you do a little search you know has something like this been done anywhere else like what about Argentina all right now it's going to go search and yes Argentina's recently undertaken significant government efficient reforms under jav which sh simil arities to the objectives of Doge comparison both reforms us Doge share a focus on reducing government size however the approach differ in context and execution Argentina's reforms have been characterized by rapid implementation significant austerity measures leading to both economic stabilization social changes in contrast DOA strategies may involve a more phased approach considering the distinct political and economic landscape of the United States it's pretty interesting when you really start thinking about it and we can even do a deep research report so just something for you to consider when you're actually making decisions that matter social media doesn't matter it's not real when you're actually making decisions that matter you have to take the time to dissect things and create Thinking Tools and ask questions and learn different techniques of thinking like Pace plans and SWAT analysis and comparables every single thing that something's been done you always ask for something historically where it's uh similar to that and it helps you kind of think into to the problem and think around the problem and you ask the question what would have to be true for this to be true so you could ask that question for Doge to be successful what would have to be true can always ask that question clear and measurable objectives strong legislative an executive support effective change management legal and ethical compliance technological integration public support communication sustainable implementation now this is not partisanship this is not a Republican or Democrat thing this just seems common sense when you really think about it so then you have to ask yourself this does Doge have clear and measurable objectives so you can start with that if you want to keep drilling down okay does Doge have and I'll start thinking yes it has an established clear and measurable outcom to guide its initiatives according to the report from Business Insider do James to reduce government spending by at least $1 trillion do potential Target of two trillion by July 4th of 2026 so apparently they did write down their specific objectives uh has any country cut at this scale by ratio of budget before successfully start thinking it through right yes several have done this Argentina Iceland all right well that's interesting uh deficit fell from 12.9% of GDP to 3.4% recovery began there okay Jamaica ltia all right now we have some examples there and then you can think around what is similar and what is different the double bubble diagram where's the overlap where are they different draw a VIN diagram and you can see it kind of thinks through these things okay and then you can look at the second thing see how we're just Drilling and Drilling and drilling does Doge have sufficient that has strong executive support legislative support from Congress appears to be mixed while some Republican lawmakers endorse Doge there's notable concerns regarding the Department's methods and the extent of its authorities critics argue that Doge's actions May overstep legal boundaries and lack of sufficient oversight what legal boundaries and it'll start searching there think Department of government efficiency constitutional Authority and separation of powers the budgetary control US Constitution grants Congress the exclusive power of the purse meaning only Congress can authorize federal spending Doo's initiatives to unilaterally freeze or redirect funds allocated to Congress May infringe upon constitutional mandate so when the lawsuits come up you have two ways of looking at them you can look at them from a perspective of these are Biden or Obama appointed judges just trying to destroy our government and Rob all of us and they're all part of a grand conspiracy or perhaps maybe those judges are interested in the separation of powers because we have co-equal branches of government legislative judicial and executive and they're interested in that and they say hang on a second here what is the Congressional Authority upon which doge is operating he was not uh voted in by the Senate RFK was uh you know and running an agency the the Senate and Congress created uh the same for Tulsi but there was no vote for Elon and there was no vote for do so does Doge actually have the power to do this well say well no doge is not doing that remember early in our uh in our setup that we said hang on a second doge is just advising but does the executive branch in general have the power to do these things maybe maybe not it's interesting thing and there's FAA compliance privacy data access concerns they and they cite the Privacy Act of 1974 the Dual roles and conflicts of interest and legal challenges litigation so you see it's not and white and the meme is not really doing it justice now is it it's a fun thing if you're on the right you see this you're like yeah [ __ ] those guys but when you really start digging into it you really have to start thinking about should there be separation of powers and constitutional Authority um and are there conflicts of interest are we concerned anything about the privacy and data access I think it's a pretty reasonable concern um for example the employees of Doge here's a question I would ask are the Doge employees operating in a skiff yes the department of government efficiency employes have operated within Skiffs however their access to these secure areas has been controversial due to concerns over proper authorization security clearances well at least that's something because if they're operating within a skiff that means that they can't take the information they're looking at outside of this GI same as a top secret information that's something that's something okay I say wait who gave these kids their clearances and what level do they have that's an interesting question go down that rabbit hole a little bit lack of proper clearances reports indicate that several Doge employees attempted to access skips without possessing the necessary security clearances ooh so they're in a skiff they're seeing secret things but they don't necessarily have the security clearances for ex for instance at the United States agency for International Development Doge Personnel sought entry into a skiff but were initially denied due to insufficient clearance levels following intervention from Elan musk access was granted leading to a significant internal disruption special government employee status El mus have been designated as a special government employee which may affirm C certain access privileges however the security clearance levels for musk and his team remain unclear house Democrats have raised concerns about potential unauthorized access to classified information by Doge Personnel yeah that's a really interesting question so typically you'd need a What's called the TS SEI so top secret sensitive compartmentalized information uh and the compartmented information is basically the stuff like the cia's budget or the nsa's budget or us a lot of us Aid is actually connected to the CIA so so the reasons behind why they're giving money is uh is also classified huh so we can go down these rabbit holes but there does seem to be something there with the privacy and data while they're trying to use the appropriate facilities these people don't seem to have the appropriate clearances so what indication do we have that they're actually going to keep some of the most secret things in the United States still secret and is that an issue for you maybe it is maybe it isn't the conflict of interest is also interesting because technically El is going to be looking at everything including agencies that are currently investigating him so how do you handle that so that's how you think that's how you analyze something that's if you really want to take the time and go through the whole exercise that's how you do it but here's the problem rational what is rational ignorance it's one of my favorite phrases r naal ignorance is a concept in economics and political science that describes the decision to remain uninformed about a particular issue when the cost of acquiring the information outweighs the potential benefits of knowing it the behavior is considered rational because individuals assess that the effort and resources required to gain the knowledge are not justified by the expected advantages every single thing that we just did up here if we didn't have ai would have taken many many hours to research and go through and fact check if not days to research and go through and fact check every single thing and you'd have to have domain expertise for it but we were able to ask these questions and instantly get a pretty decent answer with citations you could trust them or not but at least they're there and thus the cost the cost of acquiring the knowledge and information is much lower than it used to be every single one of our political systems and economic systems is in some way constructed in a democratic system for rational ignorance you're expected to not want to be informed or actually understand how any of these things work because they know it takes a long time for that and the thing is if you spend all that time your vote is exactly the same and your political power is exactly the same and that's why a lot of people are so harsh to the American people oh they don't know anything they're stupid they uh they don't think about stuff and they stay uninformed about things well yeah you can stay uninformed about things but here's the problem if you get informed how many hours would you have to spend how many days how many weeks how many months and then the more informed you get just get angrier and angrier because there's nothing you can do and unfortunately uh just gets worse and worse over time because you watch more and more [ __ ] happen and you just get angrier um and so now with AI every single person can go very deep on things and we haven't been doing this long let's take a look this video has been going on for 26 minutes and we already have a better understanding together of the Doge situation than 99% of the people in America honestly you do you now know that Doge employees tried to access a skiff but probably don't have the clearance level you now know that Iceland and lvia and Jamaica and Argentina tried to do these types of things uh you you've thought a little bit about some of the different areas of uh that would have to be true for Doge to be successful and you're forming opinions on these types of things the vast majority of the American people do not do this level of analysis we even have a pace plan for Doge for those of you in the military who or who were in the military you know we have all this stuff available at our fingerprint and this is just 40 and five is coming out and it's 10 times better and lamba 4 is coming out and grock 3 is coming out so that's really remarkable now the other side of this is misinformation you'll hear this a lot by people that are enemies of free speech and enemies of AI so here's a picture it's pretty cool picture there you go he said Professor Oldman was never seen again he's got that little [ __ ] eating grin on his face so interesting question is this picture AI generated do you notice any irregularities image you want more in depth analysis I can apply that yes it's got facial and anatomical inconsistencies unusual artifacts backround issues and text artifacts do a deeper analysis and we'll go ahead and analyze the picture do a deeper analysis takes a few seconds and lo and behold we will have an answer in just a moment the execution state was reset cleared the uploaded image pre please please re-upload the image all right well anyway you can take any picture any artifact you see and you can always ask was this AI generated and then it can generate a report for you basically on why it's generated by AI or not it's going to become increasingly hard to determine whether things are true or not because AI is getting very good but AI can always detect ai ai will keep ahead of AI it's just how it is because there's telltale signs of these types of things sometimes it's a bit too good so our capacity for analysis is extraordinary and our capacity for detection of fraudulent artifacts is extraordinary now it's at superhuman levels higher than the FBI was in the 1990s you as a person and that's pretty cool so there's a gentleman he's got a lovely video right here uh Chris Meisner uh and he uh runs a channel called unsupervised learning and he created a framework called human 3.0 and he has these different concepts substrate fabric TS Damon and human 3.0 highly recommend this video you can just kind of search it right here how my projects fit together on supervised learning uh and he talks about kind of like where the future is going and how to think around things and articulate a mission and manage yourself using Ai and I think he's he and Dave Shapiro are two people that are really thinking deeply about how do these tools change who you are and how you interact with the world and interact with other people and as a final thing there's this video I ran into uh from hexi Club the pulse chain Community one that has a lot of trouble and there was a letter uh that was fraudulent so I never sent this letter but they don't really care about things and so basically it's a fake legal letter from John Deon who was not involved and I never retained him and I don't have any relationship saying that I and the cardo Foundation that's your first sign that this is made up want to take down uh something on the pulse chain Network called Ada because it's causing all this damage it's obviously not true well the person who created the video didn't care and is broadcasting this information this is why what Elon did with Community notes is so powerful because I would love to community note this and say this is not a real news item you're broadcasting a lie something that doesn't exist but I can't with YouTube because a system is not like that whereas these systems will get Advanced enough and grock is getting Advanced enough to be able to do this type of stuff but fake news propagates and currently right now no matter what I say or do there's going to be a group of people in the hex and pulse chain community that think I and John Deon got together and sent a letter to pulse chain whoever is and judge me accordingly and you can't talk him out of it going back to the original premise of the video propaganda misinformation repetition of propaganda and misinformation they get into you like a disease and they eat away at your critical thinking skills and it takes an enormous amount of effort to convince people that things that actually aren't true aren't true and they just get into these conspiratorial death spirals in these Loops so we have to take a position at some point where we take a step back and anytime we see something we analyze it for a little bit and use AI to help help break us out of the loop now a lot of people will say but wait a minute here Charles AI is leftwing and biased and everything that comes out of open AI is wrong and it's all for Joe Biden and all this other stuff and it's absolutely true that if you train the entire internet and you focus on certain things that are publicly available like academic literature and political Reddit you're going to get a leftwing bias there just that just that Truth uh that's why Gro exists and that's why people have uncensored some of these models and done things so pick a model that you think is reasonable it's not a good excuse to Discount all of AI because you think that all of AI has been woked to a point where it's completely useless and yeah you'll availability VI bias example you'll say well Gemini made the black Nazis okay yeah it's true they overrode the master prompt and did a bunch of stuff for that and they turn it into RoboCop 2 but what the hell does that have to do with llama an open source model or a deep seek an open source model or open AI most recent models are you inferring that they're all exactly the same the people at Google did that come on you're overestimating the remit of these things and also we just did that whole analysis together with the AI tool and is there anything wrong with that analysis it seems to be pretty balanced and objective when we took the time to walk through that analysis okay and the thing is that we have recused ourselves from the responsibility of doing that and we're starting to attach ourselves to political groups and philosophical groups religious groups and say I will just parrot the party line and I'm just going to push that forward that's why the majority of all the Democrat senators all of them uh voted against RFK today they voted against a Democrat and they say okay there's a set of things that we can't do anything about and the reality is that you know his hands are tied he's not going to be able to do much that's kind of the vaccine stuff and these other things but this guy's much more likely to implement Universal Health Care than he is to get rid of Medicare and Medicaid because of the way he's on the political spectrum and if you're on the left that is the greatest gift you've ever been given to have somebody like that who can talk to both sides very effectively it said you choose to throw them away call up a conspiracy theorist and burn them to the ground and discount the Merit of all the arguments that he made said he's anti-science and conspiracy theorist you use these pejorative titles did anybody do those things did anybody look at those things and try to find specific incidences and facts and other such things and walk the way through did anybody read the books that he wrote uh the case law that he made from the lawsuits that he had and the ones he won anybody do that because he won lawsuits so obviously there was some litigation involved here his old guy it's not like 20 it's been around for a while there long life history there and there's a lot to it but there's a lot more to the story than just a symble lab single label remember a lot of people were labeled conspiracy theorists about Co it turns out that the CIA just announced that Co was made in a lab we were all deplatformed in 20120 for even uttering those words you know how many times that have to be true before we start waking up saying maybe there's a requirement for some more depth you will see yourself getting into these cognitive traps again and again and you'll see yourself playing these games and connecting to the group rational ignorance is what causes it and people want meaning in a meaningless World they want uh to feel safe and protected so they attach themselves to these types of things and to break out of it to break out of the narrative it takes a little bit of effort a little bit of courage and ultimately you will be disliked even as I make this video there's people criticizing me real time and criticize the video and the comments they'll do so and in the comments on Twitter they'll do so just I accept that it doesn't diminish the message and it doesn't diminish the intent of what I'm doing um instead all it does is just proves the need for it there is nothing I've said in this video that should elicit such a radical response or a proclamation of me being a criminal and an EV evil person I'm just telling you to think for yourself I'm just telling you to use Thinking Tools that you are the first humans in the history of humanity that have the ability real time to open up a site on your browser or in your phone click a few buttons and be able to get a PhD level analysis done over the totality of all the information of humanity about any topic any Topic at all you're the first humans to have that capability there's never been a time in American history where we've had this power or world history where we've had this power you don't need to cling to groups anymore you don't need to be loyal to Democrats or Republicans or in group thing you're not in a bucket break out of it get out of the cave than think for yourself go on the adventure about any topic you want abortion global warming vaccines military intervention restorative justice lgbtq rights whatever the hell you want just go on a journey and let's uh let's see what see what happens you know and uh and let's try to understand it think for yourself don't let other people and print who they are what they are into your brain and broadcast into you and also so accept the truth it's a hard one it really is that the majority of the stuff in your brain right now does not belong to you they're memes and propaganda and influence that has been installed in your brain by somebody else maybe it's your religion maybe it's your political party maybe it's the mainstream media maybe it's avertising and it's installed it in your brain for the purpose of influencing your behavior in a ways you could not even predict to make money or to get power or to prevent you from going crazy and killing people and creating social stability that's just a fact and that's why we see these contradictions and glitches in The Matrix and the problem with these tools are so powerful now they give you the ability to start realizing it it's almost like we live in a simulation it's like the 13th floor that movie and you discover that you're in a simulation you discover that that uh that that exists this is the tool that lets you break the Matrix break out of the simulation and realize that there's something more to the story that's truly an incredible thing when you think about it really is how how is it Humanity stumbled across this from something so simple as predicting the next word the Transformer is as as meaningful but advented as the transistor was in the 20th century and it will fundamentally change the reality of what it means to be human and it's our decision what we want to do with it and you can use it to make everything better you can use it to actually understand what's going on you can use it to enhance your meetings and you can also under use it to develop an opinion about stuff you know when we went through that list together this is a thinking point right here you know we have these things that have to be true for this to work there's seven things here you can really think about that as a thinking experiment pull out a white piece of paper and get a pen and pencil and say okay well do I think there are clear measurable objectives do I think there's strong legislative and executive support and if so how long do I think that's going to last do I think there's effective change management do I think that there's legal and ethical compliance do I think that the technological integration is going to be sufficient do I think the public support is going to hold and the communication that they're doing right now is going to hold do I think it's sustainable for communication and public support I don't really think going to Twitter and tweeting every day is sufficient for communicating something of the scale of Doge there should be a uh well sourced document that comes out every single week maybe Friday or Wednesday or whatever uh articulating all the things they've discovered and they they need to have a clear road map of every agency and they need to have an Ama and a press conference on uh on a weekly basis then you can tweet things that you find but it really it's clear that the communication is being wired up for outrage which is why they talk about condoms to Hamas which turns out wasn't true and uh and other things but they're not really talking about a broads scoping strategy for these types of things and typically when you do an audit you create a baseline of behavior and after you've done the Baseline of behavior then you talk about what are the remediation recommendations that exist there and you get Buy in and support for it which is why we asked that question when we uh we took a look at it so if you scroll back up here and it said uh this right here there we go wouldn't Doge make sense what Doge would look like risk of high-s speed overhaul a compromised but radical reform this type of stuff right and then you could ask well guys why can't we just do this and the obligation is on the government to answer that question oh sorry I forgot I wasn't sharing my screen I was talking for the whole time not even sharing my screen that's great but uh you know it's it's just something to think about uh you know a final point and I'll stop my rant for the day um is that we like collapsing people into one-dimensional things you know just a single point we say that's that person I know that entire person uh and people do this you know a lot with me it completely collapsed me and we got Charles hoskinson completely pegged and figured out um it is such a disservice to yourself to do that to anyone every single person you meet from the homeless guy on the side of the street holding the sign to the gal at the coffee shop serving you your Starbucks uh to if you meet the president of the United States all those people are nuanced people with parents nuanced lives hopes and dreams ups and downs accomplishments and failures shameful things they've done and glorious things that they've done moments of Happiness moments of sadness every single person you meet and behind this microphone I've had tens of thousands of meetings throughout my life uh and I've met so many different people and I've always tried to keep it in the back of my head to keep an open mind and I've spent an enormous amount of time you know trying to develop thinking skills to help navigate this very complex world it's what allows me to run businesses as diverse as I do you I run a synthetic biology company makes glowing plants I run a biotechnology company makes stem cells figuring out how to apply those and reverse aging we're competing with Dam mantis's X prize right now we're on the short list uh you know I run a medical clinic with 12,800 patients and we are trying to reform health care and figure out better ways of doing that that alone is a full-time plus plus plus job but at the same time I got to be a bison Rancher and I have to figure out how to raise all these bison and uh I wasn't watching it close enough and they bred like rats and now I got 800 of them I should have 400 you should see a lot of the grasses Munch down I got to not only reduce the her size but I also have to now recede a whole bunch of areas and we're in a drought and state just cut 80% of my water so I got to figure out how to grow my grass back with 80% less water how about that and then I also own a restaurant been trying to get that open then I do IO right got this huge crypto thing that I'm doing all of those require me to have an open mind all those require me to switch contextes and on any given day I could be talking to a head of state or I could be talking to uh somebody who runs the DMV in Wheatland Wyoming population 3,500 people and in my mind that when I have that conversation with the person is the most important conversation of that moment it's one of the shittiest things when you're talking to a person and it's absolutely evident that that person wants to be talking to somebody else and they're trying to get away from you I remember how small I felt when I was at Henry Kissinger's birthday party and I ran into to Eric Schmidt I walked up to Eric Schmidt because I had run into him before at his birthday party uh in uh Beverly Hills and I said hi great to see you I remember when I was at uh your VC thing and he very pleasantly and politely said hello and it was very evident he had no desire to talk to me walked about his way we could have connected could have had a conversation we actually have a lot of interest some of the research actually we do is extensions of research that he did when he got his PhD in computer science I do blockchain stuff he's interested in blockchain stuff but um didn't see any value in talking to me and that sucks but it happens all the time people are busy but as humans we do this to each other uh we collapse people in and everything gets So transactional eventually you get to a point where anything you see it's just a calculation of does this benefit me and if it doesn't I won't engage and if it does I will that's pretty dystopian and that's where humanity is at right now I hope with these new tools we can start breaking out a little bit I really do uh the uh video that I recommended actually let me share my screen again up here this hourong video has this concept of uh Damon or maybe it's TS I think it might be Dam actually yeah the personal API broadcast so it's an augmented reality concept that he came up with and basically you can put your preferences inside of it and when people look at you uh they can actually see through AR basically a lot of stuff you're interested in so let's say you walk into the coffee shop and you look at a person they have this Beacon turned it says this person is interested in all these different things and you have a personal AI simulacra of yourself and you have that Beacon turned on so if there's a person that you think you'd be interested in talking to just because they're an interesting person your AI will begin to engage and they'll kind of sort it out and feel it out if it would actually be a good conversation and if it is gives you a ping and says that person over there is the person you should really talk to and here's the reason why and they get the same message and they walk over and talk to each other pretty remarkable when you think about it but maybe that's the way we break out of this people aren't talking to each other people aren't engaging with each other anymore that one-dimensional collapse that uh that we have I don't know it's uh kind of an interesting when you think about it so I hope this video is of some use to you I uh hope you guys understand uh you know where I'm coming from and I hope it gives you a better Insight who I am you know I am not a partisan I don't work for president Trump and I don't hate you if you're politically on the left I only look at actions and behavior and there are days I wake up and I'm very excited about certain actions and behaviors and days I wake up and I'm very dismayed there was a kofka esque environment that was created by Gary gendler and the rest when they said come in and register and the people who tried to do that were sued like coinbase and we were persecuted viciously and violently attacked every opportunity that they had and it got to a point where they put my friends in prison they arrested Roger ver that wasn't okay that was wrong they arrested and convicted CZ that wasn't okay that was wrong he's a good man he's a good Fran and he deserves a pardon as does Roger and it wasn't an academic exercise these are people I've met I know I've smoked cigars with they're good humans and I know that they have a lot of Integrity as people and they had to survive in brutal vicious business environments where a lot of people did cheat like Sam bankman freed and they kept their morals throughout the entire thing yet they're the ones who get arrested too it's extraordinary thing uh and for a brief moment it looked like they were going to get away with it the government now we're on the other side of it and I have a lot of cautious optimism that this garbage will come to light nothing makes me sadder that because people hate Trump so much they're unable to even acknowledge for a moment that maybe just maybe there's a point to some of the things he's saying especially in the cryptocurrency space and I keep being told the shoe is going to drop and all the promises made won't be done but we have a byic camera working group in the House and Senate we're going to start passing cryptocurrency legislation in the next 100 days Ross alook was pardoned The Sovereign wealth fund concept has been established and there's a strong possibility that uh the United States will start purchasing Bitcoin as a strategic asset these were all promises that were made and they have been delivered there is a cryptar there is a executive director of the crypto commission there are people waking up every day trying to fight now for the crypto policy in the United States to be reasonable insane the cftc director was the former head of policy of a16z the sec's crypto task force is being led by Hester Pur who has always been fair and reasonable I know that because I met with her in person at eth Denver and I had a great conversation with her uh and she's very smart and very talented and very capable and more importantly is fair as a person so these were promises made and these were promises delivered I don't care what your politics are those are actions they happened and in the prior Administration people lost their bank accounts people were sued people were imprisoned and our entire industry was maligned and told basically that we're alt-right extremists and we even found out that USA money was given to professors to write books and papers about us being right-wing extremists and that still lives in the mere of all these propagandized people so they're not all the same sometimes things are different so I'm happy that we have reformed does that mean everything else is great no but can I at least be happy about this thing can I at least be happy that after four years of hell that am I allowed to be happy about that or not is your derangement about this man so extreme that you'll deny me that privilege because everything you're told again and again the world's a complicated place it really is and let it be complicated don't succumb to the temptation of simplification for the sake of Sanity embrace the complexity and enjoy the madness that comes because that is where you find love and that is where you find peace thanks for listening everyone cheers
