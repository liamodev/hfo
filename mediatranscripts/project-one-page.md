hi this is Charles hoskinson broadcasting live from warm sunny Colorado always warm Always Sunny sometimes Colorado sometimes Wyoming back in the office had a lovely dinner last night with Congressman crank down in the springs just uh going through talking to all those Congress Critters and having a great time learning about their needs and talk about cryptocurrency business and now that I'm back here wanted to announce something that uh you guys can work on throughout the year and we'll have some prizes come rare Evo so I got to thinking what would be the ultimate dashboard to track for the cardano ecosystem you know we have uh things and let me show my screen real quickly here wow so we have like Aus stats for example and they kind of have a dashboard and they talk about price and market cap and pools with stake and hold ERS and circulating Supply and total stake and transactions per epac and you know all these types of things and drill in a little bit you got some D statistics like 834 of them and amount of delegators amongst other things you got uh utxo oh come on now you need to load there come on Billy you can do it so well that's loading you got tap tools talks about all the various tokens and what's going on in cardano land but you know see if it shows me ah there we go so you got you tixo shows the blocks real time got some stats right here discover interesting transactions blocks the men poool all kinds of stuff but what we don't have is a dashboard of things that we consider as an ecosystem some kpis you see now that there's decentralized governance there's a natural question ask of what should we track and I got a list of things here that we track we think about you know so there's tvl dii tvl transactions and active addresses code commits GitHub commits you can take a look at uh daps dap volume contracts Community governance statistics decentralization consensus look at blockchain size cardano is about 100 86 gigabytes in size bitcoin's about 640 salana for comparison is 300 terabytes if not larger fact the active state of salana are 200 gigabytes just to give you a sense of that cost about $225,000 a month to run a salana node how much does it cost to run a steak pool per month in cardano there are thousands of different ways that you can chop chop up and look at cardano as an ecosystem and the point is we absolutely need as an ecosystem to come together and develop One dashboard that we consider to be the mother of all dashboards that we use and track for core kpis of the cardano ecosystem why because your Congress Critters your DS and constitutional committee members on an annual basis are accountable for making those dashboard numbers go up make them better make things look better inside the ecosystem well if we don't measure it how can we know that things are improving and if we don't measure it how can we know when we have a road map and a budget what is relevant to what for example we could track TPS kind of hard to measure but we could track that and we'd say well the Mad Dash towards Laos we think will improve the situation by this rough order of magnitude as an example uh we could track budget outow and say we think this will improve tvl we could track stablecoin tvl we could say okay well we think this budget action with the treasury will improve the amount of stable coin in circulation on cardano you track it then you can improve it so here's my announcement I would like for the ecosystem to get together and creat a whole bunch of demos of candidate dashboards find the data sources or and elaborate the story of how difficult it was to aggregate it what could make it easier uh and then we'll have contest at uh rare Evo and a prize for the uh the winner we'll put all the details together and figure out what's appropriate for it but something probably in the five figures range six figures range we just have to figure out how to do all the te's and cross the te's and Dot the eyes on the terms and conditions but it would be nice to basically have teams of people think about this problem bring it together and I suspect people in the analytics business the zerberus and the Ada stats and the others will take a crack at it but then the goal would be for this to become the canonical tracking dashboard of ecosystem metrics that we all agree on as an ecosystem are important and then you hold your DS accountable for it and you hold all of the institutions that are making things better accountable for it and then we have a very fact-based kpi driven uh uh Pursuit you know the other Advantage is when we talk about marketing Kardash when you talk about quarter after quarter progress when people say we're a ghost chain and there's no daps and we've achieved nothing then you have a dashboard to refer to and you can show quarter after quarter the Improvement of core kpis and you can take them on a journey and say do these things matter to you and if they say well yes they do say Well they're improving quarter after quarter they're moving in the right direction we seem to be a healthy vibrant growing project isn't that what matters and if they say no no no you're not number one and therefore you're bad he said but the trends are looking good and if you extrapolate over time we will eventually beat these guys uh and so you can really determine if there's good faith but ignorance versus there is shill and there's no good faith inside the argument they also May disagree on the kpis that we set and then at least we understand each other is for example if the only kpi they care of is let's say price and the price has been flat but all the other statistics are looking amazing and they say cardano's made no progress well in their mind maybe that's true and if that's their only kpi that matters at least we understand each other instead of saying you're a bad person and they say you're a bad person we need to agree on a common reference frame uh for everybody to be there and what's nice is uh then you know we can have a CommunityWide conversation about what is required to improve each of these kpis now I said we have internal ones that we track and the road map that was proposed with intersect and um IO uh we think will improve the State of Affairs and really the three things I tend to think about is does it make your life easier as a user uh so in some way make it easier to use cardano does it make a Dap developer somebody building on cardon's life easier you know better faster cheaper better workflows easier Integrations etc etc and the third one is doesn't prove liquidity interconnectivity and overall standing of cardono so those are kind of the three categories that I tend to think about we look at Laos you know it makes everybody's life better and makes a more attractive development platform so it hits all three categories you get faster finality you get a higher TPS rate you clean up a lot of garbage along the way so it's easier to integrate with the chain etc etc uh when you look at other things like progam pring language improvements they tend not to matter for the end user but they sure as hell matter for the DAP developer who has to spend quite a bit of money and time wrangling things so aen for example massively improved the the State of Affairs for many people in the ecosystem and so that was a good investment and a very high return investment for the ecosystem as a whole it also allowed plutus to turn slowly into a high Assurance language and it allowed people to further differentiate what they need and when they need it great so wallet improvements are in that first category does it make the user's life easier so things like zp 30 the new multisig standard we're working on and a whole bunch of things to make the wallets easier to work with and use wallet standards these things they make cardano more fluid and uh ultimately a better experience for people and it's right where the action is it's in the browser it's on the cell phone this type of stuff prove the liquidity that can be growth hacking marketing exchange listings these types of things so those are kind of categories I look at I'd like to combine those categories with a kpi dashboard and and we can ask objectively speaking how do we improve each of those and bring specialists in to have that conversation but this is how decentralized governance works you have to bring the community together you have to have a conversation about what matters to us and what are we going to broadcast to the rest of the world wouldn't it be awesome if politicians did this you look in the United States or Europe or other places and they say well the opposition party is pure evil and literally a Reincarnation of Hitler and if you elect those people uh they will destroy everything murder all of you and put you in death camps and then the other side says well the opposition party is literally Joseph Stalin uh you know and uh if you put those people into power they they will form Googs and murder you and and drown your puppies these things and say okay that's great I'm glad you guys really don't like each other but at the end of the day what are the kpis of America what should we care about what's the last time you had a politician come and say this is where education sits and here's our plan to take it from this number to this number this is where our national debt sits and here's our plan to take it from this number to this number this is where we sit in healthcare as defined by this set of metrics and here's where our peers sit and here's what our plan to take it from this number to this number etc etc they never have a kpi driven conversation why because they did they'd be held accountable because you'd be able to come back to them next quarter and say you promised me we'd go from number 40 to number 35 and they'd say well you know it's complicated you know the index is wrong it's politically biased blah blah blah that's why we have to come together as an ecosystem if we want extreme accountability in the leadership of the protocol we have to orient the leadership of the protocol in certain ways the other thing is not every everybody is uh good at everything as we saw with Sebastian from DC spark uh he vot abstained with the Constitution vote and he had a very good answer why he did that he said there are certain things I am a domain expert in and there are other things I'm not so those things I don't know I'm going to abstain and the things I know really well I'm going to have strong and passionate decisions about and vote on those things so similarly when you look at a kpi set there are going to be people who are experts in one or two of those things perhaps more but not all of them and so that allows them to zero in and help guide a strategy for that particular aspect and then work with their colleagues to create a more holistic strategy uh across the board so I think the time has come for project one page and uh we can all come together as an ecosystem I'd encourage DS I'd encourage people in the statistics business to start talking to each other IO is always available to brainstorm people outside of the ecosystem can come on in if they want to win some prize money uh and uh you know it will let it run until rare Evo when people come to rare Evo we can have a nice vigorous demo day people can showcase their one pager you know build a little website and showcase all the stuff can have dummy data but uh you have to at least have the categories right and uh the hope is that you know we get to something that the ecosystem as a whole really likes really enjoys and then that will be the canonical set of statistics and then every single interview I do I'll bring up that one pager I'll just have it there in the background maybe I'll even get a monitor replace one of those boards uh I got right there the the board on the the right I never use um so I'll replace that with a big monitor that just has a permanent uh real-time tracking of that uh of that dashboard or something like that and they'll say okay there we go this is cardano in a nutshell the one pager so you have governance you have tvl you have staking you have block size you know you have a state size of the chain you know you have transaction volume you have the number of chain transactions maybe come a meaningful transaction the centralization index all kinds of stuff floating around so we can take a look at that and uh as an ecosystem we can come to a Consolidated set of things and then at that point we can talk about how do we win thanks everybody cheers
