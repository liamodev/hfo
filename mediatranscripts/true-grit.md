hi this is Charles hoskinson broadcasting live from warm sunny Colorado always warm Always Sunny sometimes Colorado today is March 2nd 2025 it's a good day and it's just one of many many days we've had over the last 10 years and you got to have some True Grit to be in this industry there are good days there are bad days we've been through all of them together and I enjoy these days a lot and I live for them but it's important to widen the aperture see the forest from trees and realize that we as an industry have a lot of work to do in the coming months there's going to be a great opportunity for us to work together as an industry to be able to create proc crypto legislation that will make America the best country in the world to found fund and run a cryptocurrency project what this will translate to is a fundamental change in global regulation everything from ma to the Middle East e and uh all the things in in between uh will change and become far more proc crypto effectively speaking that a window will open up for all markets Trad find web 3 to merge and to create a single global economic layer that runs 24 hours a day seven days a week with principles baked into it there are a lot of Standards out there and we're very competitive in this industry and of course as one of the creators of cardano I'm a little biased when I say we have the best solution but the reality is there's plenty of fine people in salana xrp in the Bitcoin space in the ethereum space and the world is a very big place it's entirely possible for many to coexist in harmony with trillions of dollars flowing throughout these systems what matters the most is that these systems have integrity and principles and they never forget where they came from decentralization is the heart of who we are as an industry we must all always preserve and protected wherever we can however we can because we have to make sure that these systems have built within them oversight auditing checks and balances as well as strong guarantees that when you use them no matter who you are you get the same usage of the wealthy and Powerful this is the most transformative technology not just Financial technology in our lifetimes and it it's already started dramatically changing the financial lives of hundreds of millions of people soon to be billions of people moving forward we are going to see the largest companies in the world begin to adopt cryptocurrencies once there is an opening of the regulatory window Apple Google Microsoft and others will enter the space you'll see in your iPhone a wallet turn on you'll see in Facebook a cryptocurrency wallet you'll see in Android cryptocurrency capabilities the same for Windows which can hold pretty much anything this will bring three billion customers into the space it's going to become very easy to kyc people it's going to become very easy for transactions and commerce to move at the speed of thought we are at the dawn of a new era of the cryptocurrency industry one where we won and we have to deal with the consequences of winning we can never allow the rails to become compromise IED we can never allow middlemen to suck all the value out and we can never allow the systems to divorce themselves with the philosophy of why they were created in the first place this is why I believe in cardano so strongly because we worked really hard over the last 10 years to try to build a system that preserves and protects the Integrity of the cryptocurrency space as a whole in the coming months as I mentioned legislation is coming stable coin is first and then Market structure after that uh many people will be involved in this process I've always been a creature more of the legislative branch than the executive uh and so I have a stronger role in remit there and I've already begun meeting with certain key Senators uh and starting the meetings in the house and there will be more to say in the coming months about that the White House is pretty crowded these days with a lot of people wanting to get involved with the process on that side and we know many of them and I think they're doing a fine job in a balance of power the United States for those who don't know our system the legislative branch writes the laws the executive branch signs them thus much of the innovation has to come from the Senate and the house and there are many diverse interests at the moment uh many things to consider and the most fundamental question that has to be asked in the legislative process is not whether a cryptocurrency is a commodity or security rather a recognition that if we had regulated the internet 1991 we'd have the best email system in the world es ske the concept of Amazon and Facebook and Google and YouTube and all the other Wonders that came as a result of allowing Innovation to take its course we should not be so Hasty to fit a cryptocurrency into the categorization of a commodity or a security it's an entirely new thing cryptocurrencies are the stem cells of human value transfer whether it be intellectual property or real estate whether it be a security or something else a cryptocurrency a digital asset can represent pretty much anything furthermore they can even represent your intent what you want to do tomorrow what you want to buy who you want to vote for we've never seen assets as general purpose as this and blendable with as these because they also could be combined with your identity thanks to the did standard which we pioneered in the United States with many International Partners through the w3c these great Innovations mean that we have a grand regulatory challenge the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 was published 92 years ago I remember talking about it with secretary Kennedy and he said I know a lot about that because my grandfather was the first chairman I said wow that's a legacy the president who signed it in law was FDR and so we looked at the executive branch and we understand that are coordinating an all government approach the law and policy that's passed could last 90 years just like the Securities Exchange act and will cover many presidents and many administrations which is why it's vital that the legislative branch take its constitutionally mandated role in article one and be heavily involved at every step making sure that we build a system that's durable and useful for the decades to come I do believe that they're up for this challenge uh having many conversations with many people in that Branch uh not only are they excited about the opportunity to create something new they're also excited about this is the first time ever that our financial markets through the cryptocurrency space can be blended with the financial markets of the world as a whole for those of you who don't know how Central Banking works or exchanges work or Securities work the world lives in a series of walian buckets divided up by nation states and there's a world of difference between value transfer and activity in the UK than there is Germany than there is the United States being in the cryptocurrency space we don't differentiate things when you send Ada or Bitcoin or ether to somebody it doesn't ask you well where's it going and what regulatory said is it under it asks you for a cryptocurrency address that's it and when you build a financial system like this this is so radically different from the way that we've traditionally looked at Financial assets and radically different from the way we've looked at Capital formation and aggregation and value transfer it does require foundationally new Concepts the fact that we could be the world leader in this is a major step forward because that translates to the next 20 trillion doll in economic growth becoming an American industry excuse me and I want to make sure that we're part of that this translates to millions of jobs this translates to a 5% or greater GDP growth and more importantly it translates to this idea that these systems have freedom embedded within them I think it's very important that not only do we have a global system that runs 24 hours a day seven days a week that that system like the US Constitution protects one's freedom of Association Commerce and expression these are immutable things that are god-given they can never be forgotten and they can never be discounted for the short-term convenience of politics or avaris they must be preserved and protected and unfortunately no one person is able to carry that torch regardless of their personal virtue as we've seen time and again with human rights the advantage in the singular unique opportunity of the cryptocurrency technology of the blockchain space is its ability to promote and protect human rights of the users because simply put you go from don't be evil to can't be evil that's why after 15 years I'm still here through all the ups and downs all the bad days and these good ones we get occasionally cardano's going to be fine as I said before we have the best road map and there's a lot of amazing things that are coming and yeah some people have taken advantage of when we were down and we'll remind them of that when we're up but now is not the time for such things time is for Partnerships the time is to work together to be gracious and the time is to get things done we have to get Bitcoin defi we have to get interoperability between the chains we got to get Midnight out we have to keep our eye on the prize we have a limited window of time as an industry to set standards that humans will have to live with for the majority of the 21st century I do believe we're in the room and we have an opportunity and a say and we're going to be in the room on the lawmaking process where and when necessary on the executive side and internationally speaking because cardono is a global project I'll also remind people that we regularly engage with Singapore monetary Authority the FCA and the UK the adgm and Abu Dhabi and Vara and Dubai jfsa and Japan and dozens of other regulatory bodies because this is a global project and while I do reside in the United States and I have a buffalo ranch in Wyoming with 800 Buffalo running around trying to kill me and I love this country and when I die my bones will be buried in this country and I'll always be an American it's not lost on me that cardano is always will be a global project because it has touched the lives of people in more than a hundred countries there's no greater reminder than that of that than when we had our constitutional convention down in Argentina as I gave my speech I looked out into a sea of flags 50 of them from 50 different countries and more importantly the faces behind the flags every single one of them was carried in from somebody from those countries that made me proud to know that we were able to bring all those things together an old sometimes old sometimes young Hawaiian born Wyoming Rancher who's proud to be an American was able to have an opportunity to bring people from 50 countries together and let them live out their dreams that's a beginning it's not an end it's just the end of the beginning closure of a chapter the book is not finished we're still writing it we got a long road ahead there's a lot more to do a lot of Technology a lot of policy we're in it to win it but I think we will and that gives me so much pride because it means that maybe just maybe we'll get out of this funk and tomorrow is going to be better than yesterday I'd like to live in a world of Hope and optimism again and I'd like to live in a world of love again where people care for each other and people want to work with each other that's ultimately what this is about it's not about money it's not about the Winds of the days or behavior of the markets it's simply put just about a world where the technology brings us together it doesn't drive us apart and the technology helps us live out our dreams instead of destroying them so thank you all for sharing this good day with us I'm proud of your True Grit too we earn this by the fact that we showed up on the bad days and there will be more to come I can promise you that but at the end of the day we will get there we will win thanks everyone cheers
