hi this is Charles Hoskinson broadcasting live from warm sunny Colorado i had to make a quick video because uh the Charles derangement syndrome has gotten to a level I've really never seen before in my life never um so there's this uh and it because he took the time to write up something I figured I' I'd make a video real quickly you normally ignore people on Twitter but when they really take the effort and they they just go to levels of hyperbolic nature um you got you got to you got to give them their due okay so Mcloven congratulations you get a little bit of Hoskinson due today you're you've gotten host for today um so many of you know that I went to Papu New Guinea uh and had a chance to work with Avi Lo and his team and we worked on uh this paper here and this was the uh after effect of an expedition that was led so you know usually in academic publications uh the first author is person who makes the most significant contribution and then it kind of falls apart from there on down uh and sometimes after a little bit you do it alphabetically or you know it just it gets a little hard when you have tailing things so this is kind of a chimera of a paper a chemical classification spirals so the the paper itself talks a lot about basically what happened when the spirals were analyzed but a big part of this was actually the sea salvage and what made this very novel from a from a paper viewpoint was that we actually had to invent a way of recovering the spirals from the seafloor uh so early in the days before I funded the expedition uh Avi and I talked extensively uh about what would an expedition look like what would we have to do and we brought this guy on board Rob McCllum and Rob is like an expert in sea salvage and uh JJ Syler came with me my chief of staff amongst others uh and we all just kind of worked together on kind of a game plan and my primary contribution above beyond funding uh the expedition was that we talked a lot about the sled design and I I advocated because we didn't know what type of material we're dealing with to have a sleuth mechanism with the sled uh in addition to a magnetic sled that we designed now the Sleuth sled didn't work because when we tested it uh the Sleuth sled uh was tested in off the coast of Washington State and it was a different ground than what we encountered in Papua New Guinea and unfortunately uh the sled kept getting jammed and so we weren't able to get any highdensity materials uh and then also we kind of planned out the expedition with Rob we figured out the security side amongst many many many other things uh and so this was kind of the search and recovery component i also ended up helping JJ run the lab because in addition to cleaning off all the samples uh we actually had to process them and get them to the XRF and uh you know find them and sort them which was incredibly laborious work at the ship and then the real science was done by I'd say Jacobson uh in lobe and his graduate student and Jacobson in particular was did the yman's work uh absolutely extraordinary work so this is the beginning of a paper uh you know it's an interesting paper but the real science is going to be done with the follow-up because they can't do much more until they get a larger piece so we kind of proved out that there's a chance that there's something interesting there and that's why I came up with the title balo for you know lanthanum uranium and burillium and it was a fun little thing to do and I'm glad it got into a journal uh but you know the it was a an more of a sea salvage uh expedition uh than true you know deep hardcore science and there's been a lot of controversy here for example there are some people that claim the sphererals that we found uh are collash we disagree with that and the paper makes a statement about didn't really take it too seriously and Avi decided uh that uh everybody was involved on the sea salvage side who actually contributed on that would also be listed as a co-author uh of the paper and then obviously the Harvard crew gets the lion share of the credit because the paper was published in a geology site so I thought nothing of it and you know read the manuscripts and uh requested certain things be taken out um for example the technologic technological origin um in the conclusion okay so then this dude Mcloven he he writes this long form article about uh academic misconduct and uh and how apparently I bought authorship and uh all these things and it's plagiarism or I'm not exactly sure what what he's going at because actually at the end of this unhinged rant uh down here is uh demand for answers this isn't just a troll anymore it's a deep dive into a scandal that questions science's soul hoskinson's authorship hangs on flimsy ground a hefty donation a sled a light edit don't meet the ICMJ's bar journals must tighten their standards institutions like Harvard must probe reaches and funders must respect the line between support and credit until then this case stands as a warning when science bends to wealth its foundations crack if it still doesn't hit the mark tell me what I'm missing i'll keep building until exactly what you need i will share every rules and guidelines tweets articles all showing the same outcome hoskinson is not eligible for a co-authorship as and also it's criminally well not criminally illegal this m this misconduct is ethically illegal within the academic community warranting investigation and potential sanctions under scientific integrity policies and I think he said something about life and death uh sorry there's there's a lot of unhingy ranty stuff here uh that's uh that's in this this garbage um there's definitely Hoskinson derangement syndrome floating around there uh guys get it through your [ __ ] skull that I exist i'm a person drop out [ __ ] deal with it just deal with it have graduate credits have undergraduate credits that's a fact went to SU Boulder dropped out that's a fact [ __ ] deal with it i started and run one of the largest research groups in the world for cryptocurrencies interdisciplinary research group 168 co-authors 240 papers almost 10,000 citations in the portfolio been around for 10 years where are the lawsuits where's the scandal where's the shoe dropping how do we have all these relationships and partnerships if we're not good stewards of the academic process and when you publish garbage like this not only does it show how unhinged you are it shows you how little you understand of the academic process in general science is a game of low resolution to high resolution you start with some ideas and some conjectures and you bring groups of people together and everybody has a place and purpose in the process from the people who clean the test tubes all the way to the people who make the theories and when you start low you're just looking for something you're looking for an anchor and then gradually you winnow your way in and you get more specific and eventually you get to break through work and you discover interesting things and typically those are going to be your primary authors inside of that so I was involved in a sea salvage operation and contribute as much as I could i'm not an expert in geology especially astrogeeology nor ever professed to be one uh but I did have a lot of fun reviewing the manuscript had a lot of fun contributing to the actual salvage side and I'll remind people if we weren't able to salvage there would be nothing to analyze which is why this is an interdisciplinary paper and part of the methodology is maybe just maybe geologists are interested in recovering other heavenly bodies from the sea and it is equally academically interesting how to recover sphirerals from the seafloor 6,000 ft underwater in Papua New Guinea or wherever the hell you're going to recover them as it is what you do once you have those sphererals is as nice as a lab is how do you get stuff in the lab so if it's an interdisciplinary paper you need both sides so you're saying the people who contributed to the salvage side are unworthy of any academic merit in a paper that's about both sides of it you're an insane person who's blinded by hate and blinded by derangement and you've developed a hyper negative view and it's causing you to go just off the rails but in general I've noticed a lot of this in uh the crypto ecosystem people have gotten to a point where their hatred for me is so strong there's no redemption there's no good act everything must be a scam illegal immoral unethical and I don't know why you got there maybe it was Lara's book or may maybe you just don't like my politics or there was a tweet that really set you off it doesn't hurt me at all i'm going to still go about my life funding math institutes directing research being very influential in the research process spinning up new research lines just invented a new implantable device the other day uh and we're running it through a whole bunch of interesting biotechnology conversations probably get a patent on that i guess Mcloven's going to write another Medium post about how I didn't deserve that patent maybe somebody else must have done it because he's obviously in the room obviously there with my people during the research process obvious you know of course he's not he's a troll but he's a deranged troll and they're starting to organize they formed a discord a Charles hating discord um there's now these parody accounts like the Fred account and the Charles account and there's clearly a movement that's going on and it's getting stronger and it's getting louder and it's getting more pernicious and it's getting much more personal really is and it's starting to to create this evil characture where they're absolutely convinced I'm a criminal and absolutely convinced I'm a bad actor an evil person uh and anything I do is bad here's the thing when I retire I'm gonna go get a PhD in math it's a life goal of mine you may not believe I'm smart enough to do it i think I am i'll go try to do that obviously I'd have to get accepted into a program and do the the uh the qualls and comps and go ahead and write a dissertation and all that stuff um I've witnessed the process firsthand for the last 10 years we've had a lot of graduate students grow up under our supervision from Colin at Cambridge to uh the inventor of the NEPA POW Dianis Syndro was right there alongside them as they did all these things under our research group it's something that I just would like to do it's a full-time endeavor and so I don't have that time to go and hyper specialize in this type of stuff but as I grow older and as I start moving into more of a chairman style role I'll have the ability to do that here's what I know while I pursue that every step of the way anything I do apparently there's going to be a constituency of people that are going to attack my integrity as a person and the output that I produce and accuse me of plagiarism and accuse me of all kinds of things with baseless meritless things and I'm not sure why i'm not sure what they benefit i don't sure what they gain i'm not sure what grievous sin and harm has been inflicted upon them cardano was started in Japan in 2015 off of about $70 million in funding cardano in 2025 is a 26 billion ecosystem it has delivered 240 papers to market millions of lines of code to market massive protocol innovations from the first proofly secure proof ofstake protocol liquid non-custoonial uh proof ofstake protocol to extended UTXO to the Plutous programming language to Miniur to the partner chains framework to what we're about to launch with Midnight it has the largest and I would argue most successful onchain governance system with Voltater and if you look at our road map from Byron to Basho everything but Bashio has been delivered and Basho will be delivered with Laos and Midgard and other things this year and next year so I'm trying to understand where the great deception and scam has happened because in 2015 I said this is what I'm going to do and we had no money and no people in 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 now 2025 soon to be 2026 11 years of my life I've been doing this and every step of the way we told you what we were going to do how we were going to do it we were wrong about the when is what it is complicated business but we did do it and we did it as best we could cardano's been running for almost eight years now seven years uh 24 hours a day seven days a week cardano has never had a major hack cardono's never gone down cardano runs and it's decentralized as measured by the EDI what more do you want where is the scam that entire arc of time that I just gave you Celsius happened Luna happened FTX happened Bitconnect happened OneCoin happened thousands of failed projects from NXT to EOS and everything in between which failed to launch after raising huge funds of money occurred we're still in the top 10 we're still here we're still pushing forward i don't understand your grievance i really don't i just don't i'm sorry i can't what would behoo a person to take a fun survey paper that has some interesting science in it which is the beginning of a larger work that some people at Harvard want to do and write an article like that dissecting and saying it's academic fraud when you have absolutely no evidence and you're saying things that are lielist i don't know why a person gets so deranged like this and I don't know why they're organizing to an extent where now this is the standard and it's uh deeply frustrating to me it really is uh every step of the way is now I know that anything I do I'm going to have now that mirror that exists there and it confuses people when they do diligence or they look at things they say I don't understand where all this is coming from what's the story and every now and then you have to have an uncomfortable conversation and of course it resolves because they look at the totality of the evidence and they look at the totality of what's been done and say well obviously there's more on the right than there is on the left so that guy's crazy but gosh damn what did you do to piss this person off i don't know i really don't but I guess the world we live in now um and we see it all around there's a derangement that's happening amongst people we're no longer able to get along if we hate somebody we have to hate them so thoroughly and so absolutely that every single thing that person says and does is wrong and evil regardless of the outcome you see this with Elen derangement syndrome Trump derangement syndrome and absolutely people on the left and the derangements there especially Hillary Clinton call her Hillary i mean people are pretty deranged there uh and it's getting worse and worse generation by generation by generation and it's starting to be rewarded indoctrinated and financial models are being built around the hate machine so now we have a permanent CDS marketplace within the Cardano ecosystem and people will make money they'll enjoy their time with it uh and they'll invent all these narratives and languages and cultures and other things and they just tell the same lies again and again until they become so ingrained that they just automatically believe they're true um I I just don't know how to solve it you know um I'd like to believe I've been pretty good all things considered over the last 10 years they've been hard um it's difficult when you look at a very unfair tell all book that uh comes out and there's not much you can do to fight it because you talk to your lawyers and they say "Well you can sue and you may win you may not win but even if you win it's not going to do much because the way it's written the way it's structured it's very hard so do you want to spend two or three years in litigation and then create a strian effect and blow the whole thing up?" Uh and if you lose well well that's going to look really bad but if you win it's like what do you get a retraction but the damage is already done people they just believe stuff that they see and they never read the rebuttal it gets sticky these things it's why the one transaction a block was so damaging to Cardano when people in the Ethereum community wrongly said that about Cardano back in 2021 it stuck and they still believe it when you go to FTH Denver or these other places they say "Why are you on Cardano that system is the least scalable it's one transaction per block." talking and you say "What are you talking about we have this whole DeFi ecosystem." And they say "Yeah but you know I don't know you know I heard this thing and it's here." Well here let me What about this thing that that's got to be a scam it can't be real why because you're one transaction a block well I just showed you the evidence against it no you're one transaction a block you see the problem the lie gets sticky and there becomes this cognitive cost to undo it and unwind it and when you create these cargo cults of of misinformation they become cancerous and they grow and they distort and eventually they derange people to a point where they create parallel realities um and this is the challenge of our time it's an after effect of social media the derangement syndromes um and now being the recipient of it where apparently I can't even be a co-author on a paper i just can't be now i'm not even allowed to do that even though I made contributions they weren't significant certainly because I'm not listed as the first author but there were contributions there there were discussions there there were reviews there in the meetings about these things i lived on the ship for two weeks with the people uh we set everything up for getting people there getting the equipment there building the laboratory coordinating with people i think that if you have 25 or 30 or 40 authors is probably sufficient for a tailing author and most people for an interdicciplinary paper where half the goal is recovery and the other half the goal is analysis would agree reasonable people would or at least give the benefit of the doubt especially if the following papers that are about the geology science only focus on that and those authors there's no evidence for the claims made but they make them and there's no consequences to making them there's no consequences when Wendy What's her face goes on various alt-right channels and claims that we're connected to Epstein through Ben Gortzel uh harvesting data on children in Ethiopia even though there was no evidence of that and it's just pure liel and slander i've never met the man we've never received any money i was like 9 years old when he was in his heyday with Bill Clinton come on it's just absurd on every level but she says it and people believe her and there's no evidence behind it and it percolates and becomes a cancer and then it becomes part of a narrative truth so then when they say a follow-on thing they fall back on the prior lie as a foundational concern say "Well we knew that he worked with Epstein over in Ethiopia we knew that he did that thing over there with those people so obviously this next thing must be true too." Y'all Yeah if he did that thing with him that must have been true but it's a lie from the foundation all the way down it's just absurd or jumping out of Apache helicopters i don't even know how that's done i don't even know the origin of that it's so thoroughly stupid i own a Blackhawk helicopter okay if I'm jumping out of a helicopter it's my Blackhawk but nobody jumps out of Apaches unless the damn thing's going down i guess there's some whack jobs SF guy that may have done it as a macho thing you know but it's so stupid on so many levels and it shows a complete lack of understanding of all these things [Music] um it's been bothering me for a while you know and uh it it has an effect where it makes you more passive and mccurial and it makes you less willing to engage i enjoy sharing my private life at times and the things I think about my raw thoughts with you i really do i And I enjoy the community that we've constructed around uh these raw thoughts i enjoy the dialogue it creates i enjoy the fact that I get to meet people with similar interests when I say I do bison I meet another bison person it's like we're in the same club uh when I get a new cat I like showing off the cat but I'm not allowed to do that because apparently I I show off the cat while flying home on my jet and the jet is bad and immoral wrong illegal and it's a scam and so what I do is I just don't share then and then I become a shut off and then when you do that then people just fill in the dialogue with whatever perverse story that they want that's what they've done to Peter Teal and uh and others there's just no way to win now and does this benefit anybody does this benefit society uh does it help anybody you know how I spend my money i have a 13,000 patient anti-aging clinic up in Gillette Wyoming that also takes care of the public health and we've saved countless lives with that it would not exist had I not been born and those lives would have not been saved had I not been born that's a fact you can't deny it run it with my dad and brother who are doctors that's a fact you can't deny it that's how I spend my money or making plants glow or you know giving $20 million to Carnegie Melon so we can formalize mathematics and make it machine understandable so we can finally solve some of the hardest problems in math and when mathematicians die we don't lose all their knowledge because a library burns down when they die and we need to get AI to capture that so that it sticks with us all the scratch work sticks with us that's how I spend my money you see it with what we've invested in Cardano and what we've been able to build there or what we're doing with Midnight or what we're doing with Lace there's all out in the open the Bison Ranch you've all seen it shoot videos and show these things how exactly is this detrimental to society how exactly does this harm people lara how what have I done so wrong to all of you what grievous sin have I committed that has so damaged this industry when you guys gave a free pass to FTX and you guys gave a free pass to Luna and all these others we're the ones who don't pay the bribes and the ones who do you see the results of what happens in places at the ends of the earth if there's so little integrity and there's so much narcissism and sociopathy why aren't there so many lawsuits and bad experiences and trails of tears and these other things i'm a public figure i've been around for a really long time still here so what do you people want what's your end game just burn everything down anything that you don't like destroy i don't even know i can't even write a paper anymore i can't even be an author on a paper anymore it's pretty sad CDS at this level and it's pretty demoralizing at the end of the day so you know what just keep doing what I do and just keep pushing forward and I guess I just have to get to the point where I care so little that I just disconnect people love it great people hate it great don't [ __ ] care anymore i guess I just have to get to that point the worry is I lose some of my humanity along the way and some of my empathy along the way it's really hard when you turn off from caring to also keep your empathy it really is it's really hard to invest in people and build human connections with people when these types of things happen again and again and again and again uh it's hard to invest in people for years and really want to watch them grow and then have them stab you in the back this foundation fight for example was pretty tough uh some people I thought would be absolutely in the camp of say we need to do something about it they were on the other side of it attacking me when all I was asking for was a community board for something that belongs to the community and they purposely spread misinformation i told everybody that what the CF was going to do and they cut the budget for IO in half they know that we'd be operating at a loss with that well they did it anyway and they went to Japan to try to sell it we told everybody in December this is what they were going to do and then they did it why and is everybody surprised to what end too just because [ __ ] Charles [ __ ] IO you know screw the ecosystem you know like we need to kind of be competitive and speed up and grow you know to to beat Salana and Ethereum and all these other guys and to have a coherent strategy and vision but let's do it on half the budget even though we're sitting on$ 1.5 billion dollars and it's just just piled up there like a dragon on a pile of gold that you know that's that's going to solve all of our problems really okay sure great you guys know best I guess you know unelected bureaucrats and it's just uh it's not it's not strategy it's pettiness it's divisiveness and it's vitrial and viciousness it's who they are it's what they've become it's what the culture has become there's got to be a better way there's got to be a better way there really has to be there's got to be a path forward to all this and I sure we can figure that one out i really can you know um I try my best every day you know and there's been some disappointments there's been some ups and downs and we do everything in our power to uh make things work well and every now and then we take a an L take a loss and you know we we just take it on the chin and we keep moving forward and uh people spike the ball with the L they uh they really enjoy watching us fail burn to the ground and I uh I haven't been perfect in that either you know it's a human thing we like to celebrate our wins and really celebrate our enemy's losses and uh we've had a lot of L's over the last 10 years but we've had a lot of wins too and we're still around we're still alive we're still pushing forward and what gives me a lot of hope is there's a lot of young people that are still fired up and the ratio of optimism to cynicism is still properly balanced we're more optimistic on average than we are cynical i still get a lot of emails of support and I still got a lot of people that are fired up i just have to find a way to disconnect without losing empathy and I'm going to work real hard on that um you know and I'm going to push really hard to try to get all this where it needs to be uh and we'll keep trucking you know Cardano is the most decentralized cryptocurrency on the planet we have the best onchain governance system and we're going to prove that by getting this budget done we got the constitution done laos is going to make us one of the fastest and always the fastest bitcoin DeFi is going to open up a $2 trillion opportunity and Cardano is going to be the crossroads for the UTXO DeFi ecosystem uh and I think best-in-class for all and Midnight is going to add the next generation to the cryptocurrency space this whole meta chain chain abstraction multi-resource consensus uh hybrid DAP concept and it has a very novel distribution model we're in the game we're not We're not out we're fighting we're there we're still in the conversation we're in the reserve we're fighting every day we're pushing forward proud of that proud that we're still relevant proud we're still here we're still doing groundbreaking research too we're still publishing great papers all the time and the labs are growing and the interests are growing we're getting very very technical and we're starting to really drill deep and solve super hard problems laos is in my view the solution to the blockchain trma i think Cardono will be first to solve that completely we perfectly balanced decentralization security and scalability we solved it i'm proud of that we just got to get in market and it's really hard we'll get it done it'll follow the sun and all this other stuff and you know get where it needs to go and also I think we're a world leader in intents and uh that's going to be a lot of fun with Babel fees being the first step in but then you know we'll keep pushing forward there's a lot of great projects to learn from uh that are in that space and uh that does give me some joy and solace and I like all the other stuff i really like the glowing plants and I like the medicine and uh those are a lot easier to work in let me tell you so much more collaborative working on a protocol actually right now um which is a combination therapy of the same protocol and ketamine and I think we have a chance to um treat depression and massively reduce the symptom set by probably more than 50% of the people who participate same protocol is already very effective and It uses transcranial magnetic stimulation which is FDA approved and ketamine um and uh there's a lot of intersection points there so I'm real excited about that you know and if we can do that change the lives of a lot of people it's really a lot of fun when you see somebody come in who's completely broken and they just can't get off the couch and they're just not where they need to be and they go through something come out the other side and they're a completely changed person and they got their life back it's very rewarding the Charles derangement syndrome people will say "Well that's a savior complex and it satisfies his narcissism and it helps his brittle ego for not becoming a doctor and failing his family legacy." The people gave me the benefit of the doubt they just say "Hey he just likes helping people what's wrong with that?" See how [ __ ] up these differences are where one's like "Well that's pretty cool good on you more people need to do that." And the other is the only reason he's doing that is because he's a bad person he's helping people because he's a bad person this is where we're at at level 10 charles derangement syndrome this is how bad it is this is how bad it's become what does that say about the people who have those beliefs and why do you build them up you have to make some decisions in the next year or two about the DREPs you delegate to you have to make some decisions the next year or two about the budgets that you endorse the entities you want to work with if you find DREPs and there are some who are actually trying to get delegation for being Charles deranged that all they have is hate all they have is we just want to tear things down and produce nothing contribute nothing you have a choice of whether to click the button to support them or not if you click the button to support them you shouldn't be surprised if you kill your own ecosystem you poison your own tray we all drink the same water and if you're pouring lead in that water you're drinking just as much as I am and understand there are consequences for that so just keep this in the back of your mind and uh as as as we grow as an ecosystem and keep in the back of your mind for your consumption of who you like and subscribe to who you listen to who you follow um especially as politics evolve there are a lot of good things that Trump has done that I enjoy deeply um but it's a bit of victor's justice on the other hand it's starting to get to a petty level that should stop at the end of the day we gota we just got to govern and we got to move forward and it's deeply unfortunate if you govern with 51% and the other 49% are deranged and angry and everything's wrong we can't do this we have to move forward the dialogue has to get better and the only way it's going to get better is we have to change we can't watch the garbage videos we can't retweet the vacuous tweets we can't like and subscribe to the people whose only business is to spread misinformation and only business is to harm people and tear people down you can't be a proxy when somebody comes to you and says "Did you see this latest thing about this evil person who did blah blah blah?" Yeah okay what's that have to do with the price of tea in China then myself is included in this set of people that has to be better i fully acknowledge that and when I see articles like this the response is how can I be better to mitigate the derangement so sometimes you just have to cut it off at the knees and say people are being pretty absurd um and uh and they need to stop but more broadly you know how do we stop this culture in general and get where we need to go so anyway I uh wanted to make a video i didn't want it to last 35 minutes but uh you know I I just wanted to talk a little bit about this you know because it's something that's been bothering me for a while and I've been trying to figure out a way to navigate all of it and get to a reasonable high ground and it's just so crazy out there and it's just so disgusting out there and it's gotten to just such a weird point where I can't even co-author a paper a fun survey paper that's interdisciplinary about sea salvage and geology without some deranged some person writing a slanderous thing about it i just I'm just at a loss i really am um it's just sad and it makes me sad for these people it really does i have a great degree of sympathy for whatever mental illness they have and uh how their brain is working the way it is i really do and it must be a terrible thing to live in a world where every single thing that's good is bad and everything that's bad is double bad must be a terrible thing to live in that world i can't imagine how bad that person's life is so anyway till next time friends talk to you soon
