hi everyone this is Charles hoskinson broadcasting live from warm sunny Colorado always warm Always Sunny sometimes Colorado you know every now and then something comes up that is super freaking cool and it's the result of just a brilliant long brutal slog and uh I have to hand it to Microsoft they they've done something so absolutely remarkable and incredible that uh I I wanted to make a quick video I'm going to spend quite a bit of time uh looking through this and actually the paper here is very dense and very hard to read but quite interesting so this is the paper here so basically what Microsoft did is they figured out how to build a topological quantum computer okay and what we're going to do is we're going to format the background a little bit change that to squares that's a little easier to see a topological quantum computer this is um a long theorized but impossible to build thingy I like the word thingy so in general quantum computers they have these different states and when you look at these different states they allow you to kind of get a sneak peek at a large expensive calculation and then it gives you some clarity on how to solve it and that sneak peek uh is efficient and so as a result there's all kinds of categories of things which make these super useful to society uh for example you want to break cryptography uh you want to like make matter so you want to simulate biochemistry or or chemistry in general there's all kinds of things in weather prediction etc etc astronomy blah blah blah long and the short is if you can build one of these things that give you the sneak peak capability super useful because a lot of the calculations that you'd want to do in these categories they take more than the time in the universe to solve so for the cryptocurrency industry We Care a lot because you could break the cryptography of cryptocurrencies most of the crypto we use but not all like for example Starks are immune to quantum computers um with a quantum computer because that sneak peek is useful for solving the discret log problem okay now what the hell is this whole topological thing about what why is it interesting so in general the power of a quantum computer is called a cubit and more is better so as you go up in the Cubit range from one to n you start getting the capability to solve these problems the problem is that as your Cubit count goes up there also the rate of errors goes up and those errors destroy your calculation So eventually you reach a kind of a threshold and you know that's currently I don't know it's somewhere around a few hundred of cubits which is not particularly useful uh for where we want to be and there's physical and logical cubits and all kinds of things beyond the scope of the video because we'll keep this brief for the moment so everybody in Quantum Computing land has been trying try to figure out a hardware approach and some of those use photons it's called photonic Quantum Computing others use trapped [Music] ions you know then this topological is another one of those approaches here's what makes it interesting and it shows you the Dogg of determinism of Microsoft they spent 17 years on this 17 years an enormous amount of time they basically first did something called molecular beam epitaxy which is a topshelf high-end way of building semiconductors and so basically it kind of looks like this one of these days I'm going to learn how to draw so I can actually make nice pictures you build a chamber and that chamber has pumps in it that make it a vacuum chamber and then you have these diffusers inside of it the eusers you have a little substrate here usually a crystal and this is cryopump okay I'm G to turn this off up here because it's messing up my writing cryopump and you shoot atom by atom materials at this uh vacuum chamber and it grows a thin film atom by atom of whatever the heck you want typically at a rate of about three micrometers there we go per hour at most so super slow so what this allows you to do is basically build any exotic material that you want so what Microsoft first did is they took indium and they took arsenide typically used in the semiconductor industry and then you're ready for this they blended it with aluminum which is used in the super conductor business and they created kind of a hybrid exotic material and they call this a toppo capacitor and the only way that you can do to build this toppo capacitor uh or toppo conductor I should say that's the terminology they're using Topo conductor topological superconductor the only way you can build it is with one of these molecular beam epit exi devices super expensive super slow and it it basically has to be built atom by atom this this alone is pretty hard to do you know and this is what your guys at tsmc or these other Fabs are are kind of really smart about like top shelf uh superconductors okay then they configured it in a way where they they took these things made nanowires in kind of like a U-shaped configuration these little Nano wires and they combined the nanowires with stuff that's in your TV Quantum Dots and a little microwave reader okay and here's where it gets crazy they using a super cooled apparatus and so typically it's a helium 3 helium 4 diffuser uh because it has to get super cold basically absolute zero you freeze all of this in a chip and then use a magnetic field and if you do it just right you can create a brand new particle that doesn't exist in nature it's called Amaya firon and what so normally every particle it has particle and then there's an anti-particle and uh and so there's this duality of nature well a myON firmy particle it its antiform is identical to its form it's like a half particle okay now why do you do this because what you can do is you get nonlocality for your cubits that's a big scary word and I'll break it down for you the non-locality basically means that the Cubit um is both parts have to be with for the computation fall apart and even if one of these parts gets hit which is all the time that's why you you you try to make it as cold as possible with your helium diffusion or whatever you're using um the other part has to be hit too for the thing to fall apart wait a minute here if I can do that for two eventually I can do it for end Pairs and uh that's called the myana surface code and it was invented around 2015 surface code okay what does this mean it means that you have a stackable way to be able to exponentially reduce the error rate in a computation and this technique can be used to put many of these U nanowires together in a single chip and if you're measuring these Quantum dots but you're in your television we're pretty good at that when they entangle you can use microwaves to read the out so you have a super Accurate Way of measuring State uh okay so all this technobabble what does it mean it means that I think Microsoft has a scalable platform for a real quantum computer um they inv invented a brand new way of making basically a a brand new material uh it's the very first Topo conductor it's it's a new state of matter that they invented just for this they had to basically create this atom by atom so talk about that that's just crazy then they had to figure out how to put it into a chip and manufacturer a manufacturer chip in a very very specific way so that they could stack things like this then they had to figure out how to get magnetic fields to be just right to create what are called mzms Mariana zero modes so basically you create these quasi particles that uh get entangled and they share State uh and then you know they had to figure out how to build this material in a way that it has a project it has a property called a topological material so you have these braided wave functions so they resist changes it's almost like putting Teflon on the surface of pan things don't stick to it you know you basically prevent stuff from disrupting the calculation then they still had to figure out how to cool it have all that stuff work at near absolute zero that's what the aluminum is doing it's a superconductor inside the thing means there's no resistance that comes through okay so they had to put all of that stuff together and then they figure out how to read it so they had to figure out how to link it with Quantum dots and microwave reader okay then they had to write a programming language for it which they did Q sharp so they have an actual programming language today you guys can look up and and use it and then they had to figure out how to deploy it so they're going to put it in Azure papaa holy this guy is uh guy's on fire billions of dollars in 17 years of R&D so whenever you do stuff like this like you invent a synthetic fundamental particle um quasi particle you you invent a new material you invent a new programming language language you invent a new chip a new paradigm uh it's a little rough but I look at this as like the invention of the transistor when Bell Labs created the transistor vacuum tubes Ruled The Roots they were very very uh uh pervasive and transistors actually did not outperform vacuum tubes but within just a decade it became blatantly clear that transistors were the way to go because they had a property of lowcost scale quality kept going up cost kept going down and density kept going up you want these properties for a paradigm these U wires you can stack lots of them inside the chip so you got density um MBE can be modified into different techniques for Mass manufacturing this more of a research process but there's ways to make something custom for this so cost will go down and they're going to learn as they build iterations of the chip very rapidly uh how to improve the cubic count and the quality of yields uh for the thing so I think the Topo conductor concept has the very same properties as the transistor for Quantum Computing it's pretty remarkable um and it's plug and chug into uh you know their their quantum computer now I'm a big fan of the photonic approach because you don't have to cool them or at least um in the core system if you look at xanadoo systems or others but they never quite cracked something like this so it's an incredible day for Microsoft um it's I've never seen anything like it you know it to ma Mariana an Italian guy he was the one who came up with this a century ago and predicted it by the way he also disappeared mysteriously just like the fans right um and nobody thought it was real and everybody said oh it'd be really cool if we had something like this and it's like the peanut butter and jelly a topological superconductor you need the superconductor um to operate these things that's kind of your entry condition but the topological properties create those braided structures that are very resistant and so they they protect it and then the stackability of this non-locality is really what's cool so the myira surface encoding is pretty cool stuff you know because you can put end pairs together potentially and they're going to figure that out they're going to crack it so very early days um but this is a Monumental achievement absolutely remarkable achievement for uh for the topolog for for um Quantum Computing in general so what does this mean for cardano well the good news for you guys is that cardano's research headquarters is University of Edinburgh which is also a world-class University for quantum computers so right now the Giga brains there who know far far far more than I do about this uh they're they're going to take a look and deconstruct this and we'll try to develop a horizon of what we think it's going to take to actually productize this if it all is possible and Microsoft they have to show some more there has to be some reproducibility in this although they claim the chip they've created already actually has these and it's running at 8 cubits so that's interesting uh but in general we need to speed up a little bit our postquantum hardening for cardono we have a group of people who think about these things and there's different techniques like hash based crypto uh Lattis Bas crypto and others that make your crypto immune to quantum computers or resistant to them um but in general the reason why we haven't embraced the them is a there were not good standards yet and B uh typically these are about five to 10 times slower and five to 10 times larger in terms of transaction size to use post Quantum so we know how to do it it's just uh you know we haven't really embraced it because we're waiting for optimizations to come and standardization to come good news is that nist has standardized these things we now actually have a suite of them and there's a lot of new capabilities is coming on so in the budget we're going to add a proposal for accelerating the postquantum hardening scheme and adding New Cape bills and features to cardano and this can be done in the two to threee Horizon I do not believe my irana is going to be product ready within two to three years I don't think this is going to create like a tomorrow thing it's just going to basically create a revolution with a new paradigm of quantum Computing and a lot of people are going to start working on Topo conductors and you're going to see massive improvements uh the tsmc's of the world can do this far far better than Microsoft can uh and uh the fundamental physicists are going to get really curious in this and they're going to massively improve the design and now that these things are real and they see them and Microsoft is certainly going to work with Partners to figure out all of these these different mechanics so five years we have a problem 10 years we certainly have a problem but two to three we won't so we need to model basically a Quantum aary so rewrite the papers from the perspective that the adversary has a quantum computer and then work our way backwards so postquantum vrf postquantum or Boris postquantum signatures that's what most people say when they're Quantum resistant uh and then also take a look at the hash algor gorithms and say are we okay with hashes probably are Grovers is not a problem there but holy guys pretty crazy when you think about it so a lot of postquantum work we got to do now thanks Microsoft who made my life a little harder on the other hand uh it's pretty magical what you can do with all this uh as a final point in the video they released something recently called matter gen and matter genen is a large language model for Material Science and you just tell what you want and it kind of figures out how to make it you know how to build things atom by atom you pair matter gen with a quantum computer you can basically do Miracles you can say you know I uh manufacture cars and for my engine I want the following properties it melts at this point and it bends with this and it bonds with these materials and blah blah blah matter gen with h a quantum computer would just sit and think about that stuff and come back to you with a recipe and tell you how to make a new material that's never existed before which is perfect for what you're looking for and tell you how to make it at scale it's just insane absolutely insane it's literally a a god creation kit you know when you think about it and same for biochemistry uh I have a biochemistry uh group a biotechnology group and there's this one thing these plasmids and basically they make any chemical you want and a company called minicircle uses them amongst many many others they've been around for a long time and they're right now using them to make fist Statin and the fist Statin is used to build muscles so it's like the muscle Pig stuff so they give you the plasma you build a lot of muscle some cases 10 to 15 pounds of muscle it's pretty cool well what if I tell this maten model hey you know what people got microplastics in their body and those microplastics I want you to invent a molecule to bond with them and that molecule will be water soluble okay what does that mean it means that you just pee out your microplastics it detoxes your entire body and I can then make that in a plasmid inside your body inject it lasts for a year as an onoff switch the uh minicircle ones do it's pretty cool well okay the model just tell me how to do that and I say oh by the way it can't bond with anything else so it's a chemically inert to your body chemistry so it creates no side effects how about that just nuts uh so that's what this does it's gonna it's going to change everything it's absolutely going to change everything and when people say move fast and break things Microsoft A3 trillion dollar company they proved that the opposite Paradigm is prudent 17 years they worked on this 17 years think about that to create a toppo conductor congratulations Microsoft you knocked this one out of the park
