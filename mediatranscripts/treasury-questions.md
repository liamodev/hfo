hi this is Charles hoskinson broadcasting live from warm sunny Colorado always warm Always Sunny sometimes Colorado making a quick video there's actually a very interesting question and I figured that it uh be fun to share it with you guys you know from time to time people ask interesting questions and they provoke interesting conversations so ratio of the d uh day s still no responses well it's your lucky day ratio you get a response today two easy questions well they may be easy questions to ask but they may have complicated answers who owns the products and services paid for by the treasury and is it the being very explicit here broader Community AKA a holder 188 I'm currently a one in 3 37.2 billion owner of the product of service or intersect or some other entity and number two where's the path to sustainability what's the image a budget space this am a request to comment on my questions with posted in their conversation Channel and neatly avoided by host and co-hosts having read the comments above and below my comments sweet well it is your lucky day sir we're going to talk about your concerns and or problems so let me go ahead and share my screen real quickly here for you okay so the first question is uh an interesting one because it's never really been answered completely in the cryptocurrency space so who owns the output now in the old Genesis days no one did we just open sourced everything and everything was a grant but in these days there's this concept of a trust on behalf of ADA holders so the short answer to your question is no one everyone or you decide so in the no one case Choose Your Own Adventure it's like those old books I read when I was a kid you can have multiple endings and various things that can happen so in the no one case that was the olden days so that's when the age of Grants so we would give away uh some money through Catalyst and people'll get it they do some stuff and the IP and everything else that was generated from that was not recovered in the everyone case what you could do is set up a special purpose management vehicle and that could then hold the output of the funding so the intellectual property and then it would monetize that and pay back to the treasury uh in some way third option is you decide meaning that uh somebody could take a loan from the treasury uh or a particular company could be paid so for example let's say a lot of you guys are circle circle circle circle circle circle circle circle circle circle circle circle circle circle circle just zoom out a little bit we're just G to draw some circles circles okay sorry you do ask about that a lot I'm just pointing that out but anyway Circle uh what happens a lot of code is written uh to facilitate Circle to operate on cardano but Circle wants to preserve the IP part of that integration in the treasury means the intellectual property belongs to them similar to when a grant goes to a third party through Catalyst and they preserve the IP okay so there's no one there's everyone and there's you decide and you have different Cho your own Adventures you say well why would we want a special purpose entity well here's an example you could say all right we're going to take 300 million Ada out of the treasury and and we're going to convert it to a portfolio of yield bearing instruments okay and that gets about 10% per year beat outperforms the S&P 500 congratulations then what you could do is have that special purpose entity make a purchase of the yield in Ada and return that to the treasury so or you could let it accumulate and it becomes a sovereign wealth fund so that's an example of something that you can do um the other thing is that we can build bespoken custom intellectual property and have a special license regime where it's free for cardono users but uh you can't license it or it's a fee for non- cardono users as an example so special structures can be set up this particular way so the question is who decides and your DP is going to decide that with the Constitutional committee so budget's going to be proposed and a budget has an ask and an oversight so ask in consequence consequences all right so you ask for something like we want some funding to do some science we're going to do some postquantum okay well how do I know it's legit oh well got peer review and you know and and we got some formal methods and all this other stuff and uh you know this type of stuff oh okay all right right well hang on hang on hang on hang on who owns it well uh you know who owns it well that could be a patchy to open- Source license that good everybody owns it or that could be proprietary and belongs to a SPV special purpose vehicle or special purpose entity that hold it on behalf of the cardano ecosystem or it could just go to Bob whoever the bob is we'll just have Bob there's your Bob happy day there you go little Bobby Bob owns it there you go it's up to you there's an asking a consequence do some sign how do we know it works is it legit well there's some stuff to prove that who owns it very good question the budget is a composition of these pairs okay budget's a set of these tpls of various asks and consequences and that set basically is the total ask that we have all right so the whole thing script B budget very that's your first question the DS and the Constitutional committee get to side during reconciliation of the intellectual property from the things being produced this is another reason why I recommended using instead of a smart contract an intermediate organization um to at least broker this so you have the uh Dev Foundation which is owned by controlled by intersect and use this as The Binding entity yeah you can pay people with a smart contract that's fine but the reason you need a binding entity is that when a company a goes there there's a concept of turning over the intellectual property that company a produces to an entity and then that entity needs to open source it so yes you can have a smart contract do that but it's a little bit more complicated and the smart contract doesn't have Legal character or legal agency or uh you know a representation in the law so it's much much more straightforward to have a bilateral agreement between two entities and have that Foundation behave in a certain way according to the wishes of the budget so you can do it that way or you can do it any other way you so choose okay so then the second question that he asked was a question about sustainability and there are three ways for cardano to be sustainable in the long term ton of transactions it's the first one lots of fees this one's not very appealing because the goal is to make the fees go down and make it cheaper and cheaper to do transactions so hard to say the second way is for cardano to become an AVS system and uh as an AVS system I covered in the prior video as new tokens launch they pay inflation and fees to it holders basically in spos so I think this is a really good step forward what's nice is there's always something to launch you know many many tokens so probably we'll sustain us for a well the third is to convert the treasury into a sovereign wealth fund that's your third option got 1.5 billion Ada give or take now at the all-time high that was worth $4.5 billion that is no joke that is a serious pile of money 10% return every year $450 million a year for the rest of time that's a lot of money so one of the things you could do is in the future convert a chunk of this into something it like an endowment just let it accumulate and then over time it could be just like Abu Dhabi where they have $1.7 trillion do or Norway which has about the same as well or Alaska which has about 140 billion last time I looked okay so you could do a sovereign wealth fund I think some combination of the three is what's inevitably going to happen you know there's going to be transaction fees and inflation inflation's going down fees will go up the AVS thing the partner chains model provides many different revenue streams for sustainability and a conversion of the treasury in part or whole to a proper Sovereign wealth fund uh what's also interesting is it can create constant demand for the purchasing of ADA because let's say it does get 10% per year if you don't want to reinvest it in the swf what you could just simply do is just buy a every year if it's this and it's $150 million of purchase demand every year once it it goes to A1 billion do could be a billion dollars worth of purchase demand something you can do just donate the Ada back to the treasury um or cycle that back to block rewards see one of the things you can do is if there's a big surplus of ADA you can also use it to pay inflation so the block rewards this is another thing that you guys have to think about not this year you see I um I did a pretty good job with cardano not to toot my own horn but you know it went from small project in Japan that nobody gave a about that raised about $70 million to a $30 billion ecosystem with millions of people and a sovereign wealth fund that you guys control with $1.5 billion in it and very strong technological foundations much criticism as I incover the reality is very few people alive have ever done anything like that full stop it's just a fact it's a sustainable ecosystem it's not in debt it has a surplus when's the last president or business leader has come around that's had something like that we did that less than 10 years okay from nothing with no VC support No Love and a lot of people in the industry on us every single day that has been turned over to you that's what you have and you have to make some decisions and I'm getting real tired of people implying in intersect as a boogeyman or there's nefarious intense all these other things you're in charge full stop you're in charge the DS are the people you select you're not an unelected cabal you the Ada holders by your lack of participation or participation one or the other made implicit or explicit decision is to put these people into Power their job implied by zip 1694 is to converge to a budget and within that budget is a commercial understanding about how the money is being spent who's the recipient of it what terms and conditions are on it and the audit and oversight I could do this had to do it for many years but I don't do this anymore you do you the cardano people it's your decision and you have Agency for the first time ever you really do it's your decision how who what when all of these types of things now of course I can give everybody advice and I did give you some advice I said look join a members based organization and talk about it there and not on Twitter because you can have adult conversations and you can think about things and it's proportional to the participation if you don't want to do that that's fine go do it some other way but that does not recuse you from the reality that you have a big pile of ADA and you have to decide where to spend that adaa we've presented a road map and we talked about a lot of things that I feel would make cardano not only competitive but LeapFrog the competition things like midgard give us a data availability and an optimistic rollup strategy spoke to what we have uh in the cardono union ecosystem things like Laos make us as fast as salana without the centralization issue things like Bitcoin defi give us access to the largest cryptocurrency market in the world that preserves and maintains its value and liquidity it's not a flavor of the week bitcoin's always going to be here things like partner chains give us multiple Revenue models for the people building blocks so that we don't have to worry about inflation anymore on the Ada side can continue to be an extremely deflationary asset these are some ideas that put down the budget is a best approximation on how to do that if you deeply cut the budget I don't believe it's possible to do that you can negotiate and talk about it but there are thresholds and limits and there are points even when I would not want to get involved because I'm not going to sign up to do something that that's a failed initiative or work for free it's your decision on these types of things it's my job to tell you what I think and I write it down as we have done for 10 years and it's your job to decide what you want to do and if you want to live a life of constant suspicion where people have worked for you and with you for 10 years written 240 Papers written millions of lines of code and built this entire ecosystem from nothing are dishonest and bad people who never get the benefit of the doubt you can choose to live that way but don't be surprised when they really don't like working with you or you can work with them be nice about it be collaborative and say well I'm with you halfway but I have concerns and then put them down on the table in an adult systematic responsible way it's up to you you can play it any way you want CU guess what you're in charge and it's up to you and if you want to burn the house that I built for you down go build another one go do that if you want to squander the opportunity we have and all the magic that we've put in go do that that's the risk and opportunity of decentralized governance that's why it takes real balls for a Founder to do that all these other Founders they continue to tell you again and again how remarkably decentralized they are but when you pull up the rug you see governance Keys you see foundations that hold all the money you see Dev organizations where only one or two really actually control all the whole thing and there's not a lot of urgency to change that status quo because their brand their reputation some cases legal risk and ego are connected to that system it takes a lot more guts to legitimately hand the ecosystem over as a Founder to everybody massive guts because you know they might it up you know they may change things in ways that so deeply disturb you that you don't even want to be part of it anymore like George Lucas and Star Wars but that's the reality because you also know on the other hand they may do magical and amazing things that you never conceived like Danny venu with blade run and actually do a better job than you can do so it just depends are you're cynical or optimistic about people and humanity and that's the quintessential question so you have a budget you have DS you have agency and if you want to work with people and be collaborative in the process people will be collaborative with you you want to assume that people are evil and are just out to get you don't be surprised that they're not and that goes for every single relationship through and through now there are certain people that prove time and again that they're either unreliable or they're dishonest and absolutely if you want to hold them accountable do so but just do understand that you lose access there's no greater example in recent memory than that than what's going on in Argentina right now I don't know what to feel de or p with this whole thing it's tough we had a constitutional convention in Argentina brought a lot of money into that economy we've been there since 2016 we opened an office there we hired people there we're investing there we're working with local businesses there we're one of the largest and most advanced blockchain companies in the world we could have gone to Uruguay or Chile could have gone to Paraguay we gone to Brazil and believe me there were a lot of offers but we chose to be there and we are there for eight going on nine years you go to an event and you're excited that because the politics environment are changing it's going to open up a lot of great and magical and amazing opportunities and handlers get in the way and Friends of the handlers get in the way shut you out and some kid covered in tattoos doesn't know his head from his ass who's clearly a scam artist who's so far in over his head that he can't even figure out how not to self-incriminate himself Jesus Christ convinces the president of the country to do something stupid very stupid and it blows up everybody's trying to run away from it and then you think okay maybe they've turned a p page and then you see a tweet today these things happen you know it's just what it is and sometimes it's because people don't know what they're doing and uh sometimes people uh don't have the best of intent and sometimes you're just not going to win I'm a very competitive guy in my career I've always wanted to win I push hard I work hard every day I wake up at 5:00 a.m. or earlier I go to bed late I don't get a lot of sleep constantly reading constantly doing I'm in hundreds of meetings every week I travel extensively and I push everything to the Limit I hate losing I really do and I hate it when I don't even get a chance to participate hate that more it's why I took the Wyoming stable coins so seriously 30,000 blockchains were excluded at a flick of the pen it's not a Fair competition it's why I hate bribery all these people were there good people that I like competing against I enjoy competing against Dominic Williams I enjoy competing against them men and others and godamn it I really enjoy competing against metallic especially when I can win I do you know because they're real people they have real teams they have real Engineers they've done real things there's no competition between us and Libra it by its very construction is a Ponzi scheme there's no other explanation it's a crime it's not something I wake up and think about it's like asking how do we compete against Bernie made off how do we compete against Enron how do we compete against bitconnect or onecoin or Theos they're not real they pray upon the ignorance of people they pray upon the unfamiliarity with the subject matter and they extract wealth from people it's tough and that's I think the toughest part of this budget process for me is that sometimes I feel like some people are trying to treat us like we're Libra and we didn't earn that we really didn't look at what we have and what we've built as an ecosystem we got to get past all this noise and this nonsense and we have to get past this systemic lack of empathy people are complicated and nuanced and people make mistakes and people do stupid things that just bother the hell out of you they really do I got this neighbor up in Wyoming bothers the hell out of me and does a lot of stupid stuff you know what if his cattle get on the ranch we take care of them we call them they come back because that's is what it is you see people for who they are and uh you just learn to find a way to love them even when you dislike them we don't do that anymore in social media and we don't do that anymore in political discourse you know every time Trump opens his mouth believe it or not maybe just maybe when I hear it I make up my own mind whether I think it's true or not true and maybe just maybe there are some days I'm highly critical of it and there are other days I actually agree with it when he said that Ukraine started the war with Russia that's a lie straight up lie the Russian military built up a massive force on the border and invaded Ukraine that's what happened we saw it in real time she went to xab was right there on the border of Ukraine almost immediately after it happened talking to people refugees who fled the ukrainians didn't send military into Russia they didn't attack Moscow the Russians attacked Ukraine so when the President says that Ukraine started the war it's just a lie does that mean I hate Trump and I disagree with everything he's done and I'm voting for kamla Harris and I'm a Democrat and all these things no it just means I have a brain I can think and analyze and think about situations and nuances and all of these things and I can make up my damn mind on a casease basis and I don't succumb to group think at the same time zalinski is a dictator that's also true you guys on the other side you just you can't get there by definition if you suspend elections you arrest your political opponents you arrest people in the Press who are critical of you and you use an event like a civil war or an invasion as an excuse well you kind of look like a dictator why do we have the moral High Ground on this one because in 1944 during World War II the United States had elections in n in 1864 the United States during the Civil War with 11 states outside of the Union under Confederate control with 6 million of the 31 million Americans under Confederate control had not only an election had an election where the head of the Union Army decided to run against Abraham Lincoln that's why we have moral authority to say you can have an election not choosing to do so means you don't have a democratic mandate You can disagree with it but it's a fact you can say it's necessary okay but it's a fact you could even have an election where once the war is over it takes effect so that the current leadership doesn't leave office until the war is over but there's no excuse not to have an election because you need a legitimate leader to negotiate for your nation who is the leader of Ukraine we don't really know and that's the thing guys on a caseby casee basis I look at these things and I think about these things and I reason about them and I develop opinions about them which are distinctly different from the opinions that you hear every day uh in the newspapers on the radio on Fox news or MSNBC or any of these other endless propaganda machines and I can be entirely wrong and I fully admit there are times where I got it completely wrong and I also change my mind when I get new data we live in an era where you're not allowed to change your mind anymore you dig in you get a single data point and you say I'm sorry I have to take this position forever and can never apologize never backed out we call it the kofifi remember when Trump had a typo and the white the white house had to just be like that was a code word he uses kofifi because no one can admit made a mistake another great example is the Four Seasons Lawn Care over in Pennsylvania the place next to the porn star cuz because they booked it at the wrong venue no we totally meant to book it here can't make a mistake or kamla Harris with Joe Rogan and scheduling that just a boneheaded mood to turn that guy down and then try to make it look like it was his fault you're stupid on that one you make mistakes it's called being human Jesus if you want to see how many mistakes I made in cardano there are many many many mistakes it was a mistake in hindsight to enter Ethiopia there's an extensive blog post about that we got a lot out of it we learned a lot about it and we met a lot of good people we wrote a lot of good software we got value as an ecosystem hyperledger a dentist and other things and that's awesome but we didn't get the outcome we were looking for now people say we lied lied about what we were there we had a contract we lawfully were in the nation they didn't pay us we tried really hard to actually honor the contract they didn't show up for meetings my Lord all the problems that we ran into we were there for years every day just showing up trying to get it done pushing for it and then eventually after they started committing human rights violations to the tigr and other things shut off the whole nation and just ghosted us we said you know what we just have to move on go do something else and every step of the way there's some critic there saying see I told you so see you guys just don't know what you're doing had the courage to show up I flew back to that country while the tplf was a 100 miles away from Attis Ababa they were setting up artillery and I flew into Addis Ababa just to resign the deal that they never paid me for for two years there another year and a half of this nonsense and garbage because I wanted it to work that bad and our people worked so hard on this those same people are still in Africa they're just in Kenya Uganda and other places and you know what we have a better product it's called realy and we learned a lot and it's growing by Leaps and Bounds and remember years ago when I had the wallet with Kaa and I was given the micr finance transactions that's exactly what we're doing and we're going to get it done I'm just as frustrated with you guys about Circle and this whole so you try different strategies you go talk to the real USD guys see what they want to do you build up usdm you build up USDA yeah we tried wst didn't work out some things work out some things don't work out you keep moving forward I need a stable coin because I want to lend it got great returns 18% with a 2% npl that's amazing and I'd love to make that retail and bring it into the wallet somehow don't know how we're working on it regulations are tough some cases they don't exist gotta go work with the bamal working group go talk to senators and congressmen all these things that's my day every day all day meeting after meeting thing after thing product this day budget this day realy this day geopolitical issue over here that day some Argentina because the president got stupid about something the next day and have to deal with that whole thing and all these different journalists call me say no comment or whatever and all the local politics in America and have to deal with that and then Wyoming GNA go to every single County now and then you have people brain dead idiots go and say oh well they're trying to bribe the state that's what they're doing with their little pack no I'm trying to change procurement in the state because you people it up because maybe just maybe when you have a process that pre-qualifies your friends and excludes a fair process for other people to compete you have a broken and bad process and if that's illegal then I don't want to be illegal you stupid that's my day every day and there's the clinic up a Gillette it's -7 -20 negative 18 these are the days got a concrete roof on that damn Clinic 3 million pounds of concrete on steel decking how do you pour concrete when it's -20 outside you got to build a tent and heat the roof where do you find a tent that's 60,000 square feet put all those pieces together make sure it's properly ventilated all this stuff do it safely it's so cold outside the birds freeze in the trees and die got to just take care of that and I got my Ranch uh you know we got the restaurant Hilltop up in Wheatland we're trying to make it nessie's parking lot's too small fighting with the golf course about it you know because we share the same parking lot turns out there's asbest in the building go figure asbest is the best us gotta take care of that because it wasn't done right so dealing with that that's uh that's Wednesday what do you do you sit on Twitter and you say oh look at fat Charles dishonest Charles bad Charles associate degree holder Charles he's a nobody nothing oh and then Microsoft just announced the most significant advancement Quantum Computing in the entire decade got to go read that nature paper disect the whole thing come up with a Quantum strategy and try to predict these things have a phone call late at night with Scientists go through some math stuff I forgot had to remember real quick oh then we got the synthetic biology oh God we got some cool coming out with that oh my God both on the plant and the animal side it's going to blow your mind there is news coming out potentially this year about a thing which is going to be so big every journalist in the world's going to be writing about it that's another thing on the list you get the idea right you got to there's a lot going on a lot of things going on I choose to be here and I choose to be with you and work with you because I want this ecosystem to be successful and all those things going on I always try to find a cardano component to those things and build on card and bring value into cardano bring liquidity into cardano and new users into cardano every place I go everything I do it gets old after a while doing all that stuff and having people come and say I'm here to screw you and steal from you or be power hungry and narcissistic honestly from the bottom of my heart go yourself you horrible trolls 10 years of my life on this if I can't convince you at this point after everything that's been done including the Constitution the problem is you get help honestly get help I don't have time for this it would been so easy in the budget process just to say this is what IO needs best of luck everybody take it or leave it and have somebody else worry about how to take care of the whole ecosystem and put all the people together it would have been probably two weeks of work for us and we just thrown it out there and hope for the best you know what would happen is so many good people would have been left behind because they don't have this microphone they don't have a million Twitter followers nobody knows their names except for a few people they don't have a marketing team they don't have any of this remit but they do stuff for cardano and they've Loy been in the ecosystem for years so to take all those people and try to make sure that they're taken care of too it's really hard and a lot of infrastructure has to be built and careful thinking has to be put together every detail and that's what people try to do and for that we get criticized and we take the criticism because we understand at the end of the day is what it is and that's just what life and change is about with Wyoming the procurement will change it'll probably take an election and i' probably take me going to every County kicking down some doors and some politicians are gonna lose their job because I'm a damn good campaigner as they're just about to find out and they're starting to learn with respect to Argentina the government really doesn't have any power anymore it's the free market you want to get something done go do that nobody in the government got one out of every seven in that country to be crypto that was the people who decided so what are we doing we're working with the Private Industry and it's the same in Africa that was the mistake we made so we pivoted set up realy and it's growing by leaps and pounds every day that's what we do lace oh man we had problems there got gummed up now we got great leadership it's super cool they're releasing all the time doing live streams using lace having fun I'm the first cryptocurrency founder ever to use Twitter as my database to store my uh my wallet you guys can download it at any time it's that secure how about that pretty cool pretty happy so if we're making progress as an ecosystem we're making progress as a culture and this is exactly what I expected I'm going to hold people accountable I'm going to kick them in the face and absolutely Trump does stuff wrong does stuff right Malay does stuff wrong does stuff right net net there are leaders whose time has come and I think that they do good things for their nation and there are leaders whose time is no longer around and they have to be kicked out leaders get to decide that they kind of very good at showing themselves the door one way or the other and we try for that matter to work with people all you Democrats say oh Charles is all he cares about is crypto well I am a cryptocurrency CEO and there's all these millions of people that kind of sort of want cryptocurrency regulation to be good and we have a government willing to do that maybe just maybe let us cook and get good crypto regulation and maybe just maybe instead of just saying the orange man is Hitler let's work together and make it bipart so it's durable and it lasts multiple regimes instead of just one because doesn't that kind of sort of benefit us all and restore Integrity to the things that we do or is all of this just not real is all of this just not real none of it matters it's only trustless and decentralized and ethical and Equitable and incredible when your guy's in office or gal but when the other guy's in office it's techn bro Alt right conspiracy theory honestly speaking grow the up really it's technology just like the internet is it's neutral it didn't give a about what you believe or who you sleep with or what you think should be done to school children don't give a about any of that it serves every single person from the president to the pope exactly the same way and if you truly believe in equality if you truly believe in Fair under the law wouldn't you want this technology to be everywhere unless you don't and you're just propagandized it's all one big game and you're a spectator sport begging for blood against people you're told to Hate by people you've never met and to those of you on the right have some principles and integrity there are good cryptos and there are bad cryptos good cryptos try to do exact ly what I just said in bad cryptos their sole purpose is to enrich the founders at the expense of the retail holders I think we can know the difference between them and yes when they happen you have to call them out Libra should have never happened full stop no arrick or qualifier or any of this other stuff it should have never happened and is my personal opinion as well that Melania and Trump should have never happened and I don't really care about the consequences of saying these types of things and if I lose access or gain access I have integrity as a person I have a mind I have beliefs as a person and it's not helpful these types of instruments when they come out and I go against the advice of people who are in the business of what to say and what to do you know you polish yourself up you put on a suit and you pretend to do these I'm not that guy I'm never going to be that guy I'm just going to be real with you every day my life's work is building things that are here forever to transform Society it's why I spent two years of my last 10 years building a governance system for all of you and now you're exercising your governance muscle deing agency and I'm dealing with the consequences positive and negative of that system and I wouldn't have it any other way it is not my life's work to launch things that go up and then down and disappear and walk away with a big pile of money the difference between me a lot of these other guys is that I've been very rich and very poor and at the end of the day if I was very poor again I would live life exactly the the same way the food wouldn't be as good the travel wouldn't be as luxurious but i' do exactly the same stuff I'd read exactly the same books I'd read exactly the same papers I'd play exactly the same video gam I'd travel a little less because I couldn't afford to do it anymore and wouldn't need to do it anymore because I wouldn't be running an international company and if I couldn't take care of Bison you know what I'd volunteer at a place where I could take care of animals and spend some time with them I read a book about the Amazing Adventure that I went on and all the cool stuff I saw along the way because you can't take it with you if you die you lose everything and the last time I checked 100% of us will it's not a matter of if but when could be tomorrow could be 50 years could be 75 years you don't know when I was a kid I loved the Simpsons one of my favorite characters was Troy McClure Phil Hartman played him wife killed him it's tragic in news radio he was all kinds of cool things and they even designed the zap Branigan role in Futurama for him would have been him if he' survived took everybody by surprise that's how fragile life is so you spend all this time obsessing over acquiring an IM imaginary piece of paper that some other group of people says is worth a lot and you acquire it by trading another imaginary thing that a different group of people says is wor a worth a lot and then once you have it you think you're really special because there's a lot of other people that live that delusion it doesn't seem very real when you really think about it now does it so that's why I focus on the utility I also love the experiences you know um I love game development I love showing people things that they've never seen before I love exploring the unknown Quantum hosy four-dimensional spaces how many of you have even a clue what that looks like and even if you did in your head have you ever on a computer monitor explored a world that's built in 40 and imagine that with all these complex geometries nonukan hyperbolic spiral all kinds of just strange weird things you have no intuition for how magical was it when you saw avatar for the first time going to the theater and it's 3D and it's just popping out at you and you say wow that's incredible that's magical my God just what did you feel the Elation the joy of that I love that that's another reason I get up in the morning I enjoy building things that people say wow it's why I made a company that makes glowing plants God that's going to be special take 10 20 years but you'll wake up one day whole city glows in the dark think what the kids will say that's my life that's what I do that's what motivates me it's who I am so when you think about the budget when you think about the governance of cardano realize that the nuts and bolts of cardano that's where it came from that was the inspiration of these things that was the intent of these things and it's for you and you're so trusted and so loved and there's so much respect for you that you have been given the ability to Burn It To The Ground if you want to it's your monument and it's yours to decide what to do with it the next 10 years are going to be tough for Humanity in general and the final point is that we're going to have to reset a bit the way we've been doing things that's it's not working for anybody it really isn't and every single Concept in society what a good life is what wealth power and Status means what it even means to be human is very rapidly evaporating and the boundaries between reality and fantasy are fading Microsoft just invented a new state of matter to create a particle that doesn't exist to create a computer that then will allow them to program reality and then create new materials from that it's Thursday it's Thursday what are they going to do tomorrow when AGI comes and Asi comes which is scary close that's Friday that's where we're at man so all this stuff is up for grabs and I'm sorry to say that Fox News isn't going to tell you what to do and I'm sorry to say CNN is not going to tell you what to do you're going to have to figure that one out yourself and you're also going to have to realize that like myself we all have been stained by the propaganda of mass media and persuasion we're not thinking right as a species and it's going to take a lot of deprogramming and detoxing a lot of hard work to get us out of this we have our biases and they're so deeply ingrained by design that it's making it hard for us to even communicate and trust each other again even people we need to trust and communicate with to get out of this nonsense and mess so you have to take a step back and realize that for what it's worth I think we're on the right path I think blockchain is a return to reality it gives us a truth however manufactured we can at least believe in and I think AI also is going to help us act as a powerful counterbalance to showcase the parts of us that aren't so comfortable these two things alone if we use them the right way I do believe we can figure out what to do next so I love all of you even the people I hate I hope everybody resets a bit has a bit more wisdom leaders make mistakes leaders do good things doesn't mean we don't work with them and we try and there are frustrating days and there are good days but they're just the same they're days and you got to get up got to keep moving forward and I hope this brings some clarity to everybody thank you
